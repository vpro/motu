1
00:00:00,69 --> 00:00:05,68
So I am the Regis professor of chemistry at University of Glasgow.

2
00:00:05,7 --> 00:00:09,84
I run a pretty big research group exploring complex chemistry

3
00:00:09,84 --> 00:00:17,52
and I try to think about how things got started in chemistry and biology and how to make.

4
00:00:17,53 --> 00:00:26,37
Ways to explore all of chemistry. And. Is that one of our questions that you ask yourself.

5
00:00:26,78 --> 00:00:35,4
Yeah I think the question I ask myself a law is is why. And I suppose link to that how. Did.

6
00:00:35,95 --> 00:00:38,18
Basically the Earth become a living.

7
00:00:38,3 --> 00:00:44,44
And I am an inorganic chemist and the word inorganic is associated with dead or nonliving

8
00:00:45,14 --> 00:00:47,2
and organic chemistry is associated with living.

9
00:00:47,52 --> 00:00:54,06
So the question I asked almost to make fun or to describe it clearly is how did Death chemistry become living

10
00:00:54,06 --> 00:01:03,77
or how did it in organic world become organic. Put simply where did biology come from on earth.

11
00:01:03,79 --> 00:01:08,37
So what's the difference between Or can you see.

12
00:01:09,08 --> 00:01:15,44
Well with that I can answer that in in a very complex way in a very simple way

13
00:01:15,44 --> 00:01:18,93
but I would say that biology uses organic chemistry.

14
00:01:18,95 --> 00:01:27,36
And it's able to build machines based on organic chemistry and the ultimate machine that biology is built.

15
00:01:27,38 --> 00:01:30,11
Is the organic chemist because then they can make more molecules

16
00:01:30,11 --> 00:01:32,65
but this is a rotter robot argument I'll talk about later

17
00:01:33,39 --> 00:01:39,44
but biology predominately is based upon organic chemistry it's a very nice chemistry or your D.N.A.

18
00:01:39,44 --> 00:01:46,75
or That all the proteins all your muscles all built with what organic chemistry and some inorganic stuff some salt

19
00:01:46,75 --> 00:01:57,96
and all that to make it work. So that may question you use right of ours. How create life from there. Yeah absolutely.

20
00:01:58,41 --> 00:02:01,57
Imagine back to when. Planet Earth got started.

21
00:02:01,89 --> 00:02:08,78
It was probably a fairly busy place asteroids meteorites love Earth thunder lightning but it was dead.

22
00:02:08,87 --> 00:02:14,72
I think of it like a beach like sand on a beach where there was nothing but the wind blowing around and

23
00:02:14,72 --> 00:02:15,55
when I say peoples.

24
00:02:15,74 --> 00:02:24,7
How does that sound on the beach in organic dead stuff turned into a living stuff to see we fish to the trees to the

25
00:02:24,7 --> 00:02:30,71
grass to the bacteria. What on earth happened. Literally warbird happened.

26
00:02:32,68 --> 00:02:36,14
Is quite an interesting question because put so simply.

27
00:02:36,16 --> 00:02:42,77
It's a chemist ultimate dream like this is the question what turned a dead chemistry into living chemistry.

28
00:02:42,89 --> 00:02:51,46
The question for me. Why do you raise this question. Well I'm not the first to raise a question.

29
00:02:51,76 --> 00:02:54,87
Lots of people raise a question in their own way in their own way.

30
00:02:54,91 --> 00:02:58,84
I guess we all have a what is the meaning question don't we.

31
00:02:58,85 --> 00:03:05,53
And we all whether you're an artist or a composer or you're a filmmaker or. An architect.

32
00:03:05,55 --> 00:03:08,94
I guess we all there is all meaning and in the things that we build

33
00:03:08,94 --> 00:03:16,31
and create for me I am really fascinated by the fact that chemistry is extremely complicated is that organic chemistry

34
00:03:16,31 --> 00:03:22,8
is complicated. The way the biology works disease works molecules work complicated.

35
00:03:22,82 --> 00:03:26,37
And I can do stuff with my hands and my eyes but it's complicated.

36
00:03:26,8 --> 00:03:34,25
So if I purposefully build something I'm controlling my fingers I can see my world. But what happened.

37
00:03:34,28 --> 00:03:41,6
How did that work without me. And so I wondered what are the steps. What are the simple steps that lead to complexity.

38
00:03:41,87 --> 00:03:44,45
So for me it's kind of that manifestation of.

39
00:03:45,14 --> 00:03:49,29
Although I'm a chemist I don't really understand very much chemistry it seems quite complex.

40
00:03:50,47 --> 00:04:00,23
And I'd like to know where we start. Yeah because now you're at. This complex. Where to start.

41
00:04:00,69 --> 00:04:08,27
If you travel answer that question. Oh gosh. I guess in my in the laboratory.

42
00:04:09,1 --> 00:04:14,62
I was always fascinated how I could make molecules make themselves.

43
00:04:14,64 --> 00:04:20,52
So what we try to do this is think would know technology another technology is bigger than a molecule.

44
00:04:20,84 --> 00:04:27,67
But smaller than say a second Pandora a spring in a very fine watch.

45
00:04:28,88 --> 00:04:34,36
So how can I get molecules to go into that nano world because I can make nano machines.

46
00:04:34,7 --> 00:04:37,77
If I can make them in machines and I had all sorts of fascinating things.

47
00:04:37,96 --> 00:04:44,14
So as an organic chemist I basically took sand stuff with simpler sand and all ideas I added acid to it.

48
00:04:45,00 --> 00:04:49,92
And when I added acid to certain sands they turned into nano objects

49
00:04:50,95 --> 00:04:56,52
and I was fascinated how could those nano objects build themselves and part of the training I got

50
00:04:56,52 --> 00:04:59,72
when I was doing my Ph D. and Then after my Ph D.

51
00:04:59,72 --> 00:05:00,49
Was explaining

52
00:05:00,49 --> 00:05:09,11
and exploring the self-assembly of sand literally how could the Sand Castle build itself without the bucket.

53
00:05:09,66 --> 00:05:13,78
How could the grains of sand know that each other. Existed to build the castle.

54
00:05:14,13 --> 00:05:18,22
And I spent a lot of time looking at that and maybe because I look back in time.

55
00:05:18,4 --> 00:05:23,05
It's easy for me to kind of say ah I was always interested in the origin of life and making new life

56
00:05:23,75 --> 00:05:30,47
but I guess it started with a fascinating of just complexity in general how could the castle build itself without a

57
00:05:30,47 --> 00:05:43,00
person or a bucket. So it might. Go out itself. You know and that's really got to go.

58
00:05:43,08 --> 00:05:46,88
Yeah and well it's not well of course the house built itself.

59
00:05:47,31 --> 00:05:53,33
If you allow the human being to be because there really thing is now I say to people who are seven forty seven is too

60
00:05:53,33 --> 00:06:00,64
complicated to spontaneously assemble so many yes so there is a problem with probability and there is a pro.

61
00:06:00,69 --> 00:06:06,5
I'm with complexity. If you say to him as a mathematician or a statistician that something is complex.

62
00:06:06,91 --> 00:06:12,36
They would translate that to as being improbable to happen on its own I think they're wrong.

63
00:06:12,66 --> 00:06:15,92
I think it's not just improbable I think the chances it happening is zero.

64
00:06:17,35 --> 00:06:19,9
So I think the chances of him for some improbable things happening here.

65
00:06:20,07 --> 00:06:23,87
I just put a number on it makes him feel better. But with a seven forty seven.

66
00:06:24,18 --> 00:06:27,51
There is a zero chance of seven forty seven one assembler self.

67
00:06:27,77 --> 00:06:36,25
However have an origin of life have human beings make a seven forty seven. They then the human being.

68
00:06:36,27 --> 00:06:42,93
Plus the technology makes the seven forty seven. So clearly the probably isn't zero because seven forty seven is exist.

69
00:06:43,68 --> 00:06:52,91
And I think that's about this house the house didn't form itself a person did it. So when you then think about life.

70
00:06:52,93 --> 00:07:00,11
And life is a very interesting thing because it's a machine that can act on surroundings to conquer It's almost like

71
00:07:00,11 --> 00:07:08,33
for me. Living Matter is somehow superior to dead matter because it can literally.

72
00:07:11,42 --> 00:07:17,88
I'm on my bike I don't feel like quite. So so for me it's really interesting about in slave stuff going on.

73
00:07:20,00 --> 00:07:22,58
So this house did not deal with itself a human being.

74
00:07:22,61 --> 00:07:29,22
Did OK what built a human being and that's why I go down from there and then you backwards and backwards and backwards.

75
00:07:29,86 --> 00:07:35,55
Down to say what is the simplest thing that could happen by chance it could make more sophisticated things happen.

76
00:07:35,57 --> 00:07:38,63
So this is where all the notion of complexity came from in the House

77
00:07:38,63 --> 00:07:51,15
and the person I often have say one thing which is no origin of life. No biology. No biology no biologist.

78
00:07:51,17 --> 00:07:57,22
No biologist no human being. No you know philosophy. No philosophy.

79
00:07:57,24 --> 00:08:00,3
I'll try and say it in a bit of a more elegant way later but it.

80
00:08:00,69 --> 00:08:04,99
That's kind of interesting and so quit essentially what I'm saying is that you

81
00:08:04,99 --> 00:08:12,15
and I we human beings we see the world and we make a pact we we understand the world we we perceive it.

82
00:08:13,2 --> 00:08:19,21
So what is it about the stuff in me the atoms in me that allow me to appreciate the world that is a really interesting

83
00:08:19,21 --> 00:08:25,05
phase transition the sand in that castle is not aware of itself.

84
00:08:25,88 --> 00:08:31,88
But you add some complexity to it and a few billion years of evolution and you have a not only human being.

85
00:08:33,67 --> 00:08:43,89
Where how did that happen. So I think it's a step in complexity and so what.

86
00:08:45,35 --> 00:08:55,65
And I mean we can go right down to the history of it but describe complexes of this research.

87
00:08:56,68 --> 00:09:04,23
So you find that there are parts. Yes So mice.

88
00:09:04,4 --> 00:09:09,14
So there's lots of I don't if you want to go down this part depending I let you die I mean if you.

89
00:09:09,16 --> 00:09:13,79
Let's go back to the origin of life for people often talk about trying to work out the origin of life.

90
00:09:14,03 --> 00:09:15,83
I think it's a really important problem.

91
00:09:16,55 --> 00:09:21,7
There is more money and time being spent on the origin of the universe and the origin of mass I.E.

92
00:09:21,7 --> 00:09:27,37
That's how he exposed on in gravity than the origin of life. There is never been a big project for the origin of life.

93
00:09:28,74 --> 00:09:37,8
But if I could understand where life came from or if I could this is my objective to make new life in my lab.

94
00:09:37,82 --> 00:09:42,6
I could then tell you if life alien life is possible the constraints of a new life forms

95
00:09:42,6 --> 00:09:47,34
and I could expand the chemistry the chemical space beyond what we know already.

96
00:09:47,71 --> 00:09:51,2
And we could talk about the Shadow biosphere in new types of life forms.

97
00:09:52,11 --> 00:09:58,33
So that's a really important problem the problem of the origin of life is that it's historical question.

98
00:09:58,82 --> 00:10:00,48
So lots of people go back and say.

99
00:10:01,41 --> 00:10:08,67
First assumption origin of life took billions of years of well everyone saying well no. Maybe just a billion.

100
00:10:09,43 --> 00:10:16,98
So why billion chemistry occurs much faster than the billion years. Evolution takes a long time we know that.

101
00:10:17,19 --> 00:10:18,87
Then when you think about the problem.

102
00:10:18,87 --> 00:10:26,34
So if complex chemistry didn't take a billion years how long one hundred million two hundred men in. What about a year.

103
00:10:27,43 --> 00:10:35,66
What about if you could go from sand to a primitive cell with a year. What would that change can then then you say OK.

104
00:10:35,84 --> 00:10:38,8
People say that's impossible. And then you say why.

105
00:10:38,85 --> 00:10:44,37
And they said well origin of life was clearly improbable clearly impossible we are clearly a fluke.

106
00:10:45,03 --> 00:10:53,25
We are clearly an accident. But that that's also a very that's not tested. So the fact we are here.

107
00:10:53,33 --> 00:11:05,82
The first assumption I make is that we're easy life is easier than you think. Where we are easy. Are you for life.

108
00:11:08,01 --> 00:11:14,41
Or you know I home or NO NO NO WAY I will. No no no. So I think there are three problems I'm really interested in.

109
00:11:14,54 --> 00:11:17,79
First of all is how to make a new life form.

110
00:11:17,8 --> 00:11:22,78
The second one is how can that life a single So how does it is a single cell

111
00:11:22,78 --> 00:11:28,51
or something then how does that life form become cooperative to make a multi cellular creature.

112
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:32,79
Because actually that took a billion years that did take a very long time.

113
00:11:33,07 --> 00:11:40,42
Could we speed it up and thirdly what happens to that multicellular creature to make intelligent had to have a brain

114
00:11:40,42 --> 00:11:45,82
and then have sensors. So I think the origin of life might be much easier than we think.

115
00:11:45,84 --> 00:11:47,69
Multicellularity might just take time.

116
00:11:48,1 --> 00:11:53,46
And then the real magic might be how we get to intelligence but I just would like to I'm a chemist

117
00:11:53,46 --> 00:12:00,64
and I would just like to answer the sand cell question or the dead to life. First.

118
00:12:00,69 --> 00:12:07,54
And I don't have a hundred million years I don't maybe have a thousand years I might have ten years or twenty years.

119
00:12:07,81 --> 00:12:12,5
So what can I do in my laboratory to speed that up and one assumptions can I make

120
00:12:13,22 --> 00:12:16,65
and if I make those assumptions about time and complexity.

121
00:12:16,92 --> 00:12:21,43
Does it allow me to say something really obvious like why you know what let's say it was simple

122
00:12:21,43 --> 00:12:24,72
and let's assume it took me time. No to no time.

123
00:12:25,81 --> 00:12:36,44
What do we then do that opens up the entire chemical space so that you step back and visualize your.

124
00:12:39,65 --> 00:12:53,27
What is happening there. What are you. What both your question. Wow. What am I doing in my lab or yeah. So my lab.

125
00:12:53,29 --> 00:12:59,36
Now is really exciting because it combines expertise I've been dreaming of getting together for a decade

126
00:12:59,36 --> 00:13:06,73
or actually probably as long as. For thirty two years since I was ten years old.

127
00:13:07,82 --> 00:13:13,97
Because it combines people who can play with computers combines robotics. It combines chemistry.

128
00:13:14,19 --> 00:13:16,02
It can it can be combined vision.

129
00:13:16,3 --> 00:13:21,44
And what we're trying to do in one half a lab is we're trying to really good chemistry to make new molecules.

130
00:13:22,13 --> 00:13:27,67
And the other half a laboratory to build robots that would do really simple chemistry to build really simple molecules

131
00:13:27,67 --> 00:13:33,53
and we're trying to say Look at that chemist over there. They're amazing. Look at that come that robot over there.

132
00:13:33,53 --> 00:13:34,15
That's really dumb.

133
00:13:34,26 --> 00:13:38,57
How can we how can we make the robot A smart as a smart chemist

134
00:13:38,57 --> 00:13:44,76
and what does that mean is there something that can the robot that can do a simple that can get smarter.

135
00:13:45,79 --> 00:13:53,69
And so at the moment we've got a number of approaches the first approach is what I call bottom up sand to sand castle.

136
00:13:54,11 --> 00:14:00,64
So we are basically shaking the sand in a bucket. And we're hoping that the grain.

137
00:14:01,63 --> 00:14:04,91
Collect together to build something miraculous.

138
00:14:04,92 --> 00:14:09,12
And we can do it to some degree but only small miracles no big miracles

139
00:14:09,12 --> 00:14:14,14
and we're finding something really interesting that small miracles can have bigger miracles

140
00:14:14,14 --> 00:14:21,25
and have bigger miracles so this is like what we call a template based self-assembly if you make if you think of a I

141
00:14:21,25 --> 00:14:26,45
want to make an arch right in a bridge and want to make a bridge across the river one way doing is to build an arch.

142
00:14:26,89 --> 00:14:30,43
But to build an arch you need a template for the arch you can made out of wood

143
00:14:31,34 --> 00:14:39,18
but what if I could make the template of. Art form. Spontaneously to film The Bridge.

144
00:14:39,19 --> 00:14:44,2
That's kind of nice and sunny the arch built the bridge in my lap or try to make sure that we can do that

145
00:14:44,2 --> 00:14:52,64
and we found a way of a molecule makes his own archway and then it makes the bridge and then the archway dissolves.

146
00:14:52,97 --> 00:14:57,9
And when you see it the bridge and the game is like going. Where the bridge come from.

147
00:14:57,99 --> 00:15:02,53
I didn't build the arch and we caught the archway.

148
00:15:02,55 --> 00:15:09,19
Literally with his trousers down by accident like that snapshot and then we understood that.

149
00:15:09,37 --> 00:15:19,3
So that's what we called bottom up. For example that one. Of the obvious that you're right about. Yeah yeah. It got so.

150
00:15:23,19 --> 00:15:23,67
Involved.

151
00:15:23,73 --> 00:15:29,97
You know I mean the ground the grain of sand grain of sand just to get that same cast of made up of sand

152
00:15:29,97 --> 00:15:36,31
and all to make a sand castle you can do one of two things you could position each the sand with a microscope.

153
00:15:36,97 --> 00:15:42,05
By hand by hand and take you a long time you could get a bucket with the right indentations

154
00:15:42,05 --> 00:15:50,21
and just scoop the sand to put it in there or you could program the sand to self-assembly like ants. And somehow.

155
00:15:50,39 --> 00:15:57,58
How do you what are the smallest rules you can come up with is a bit like trying to work out those rules. So another.

156
00:15:59,1 --> 00:16:10,29
Much way. Yeah. So. So hard. One another archway that would do itself spontaneously.

157
00:16:10,57 --> 00:16:15,07
Well it's from us that it's a bit like us some making a snowman.

158
00:16:15,57 --> 00:16:21,03
So we made a snowman outside of my son the other day and it's a bit like um.

159
00:16:21,05 --> 00:16:27,91
Ask no man was made up of four snow balls and we started rolling the snow together to make a big ball.

160
00:16:27,93 --> 00:16:33,31
So we just rolled the snow for maybe ten minutes me got a ball that was basically half a metre stop.

161
00:16:33,59 --> 00:16:40,13
Then we wrote roll it for less time and we got maybe a quarter of a meter. Put on top and another one.

162
00:16:41,4 --> 00:16:47,45
For basically half of a quarter of a metre on top. So we have a fat. Less fat.

163
00:16:48,01 --> 00:16:55,51
So its name is so he has a way of doing it to say could I allow a stone at the top of the hill to roll down the hill

164
00:16:56,35 --> 00:17:01,61
get enough snow to become a big ball and then split into two to make another ball

165
00:17:01,61 --> 00:17:02,77
and then they would assemble at the bottom.

166
00:17:02,89 --> 00:17:07,77
It could happen randomly if you did enough times and that and all

167
00:17:07,77 --> 00:17:13,97
and that's what we're kind of doing in the lab setting up random snowballs to make say ah there's a snowman.

168
00:17:13,98 --> 00:17:21,31
But there's a snowman can we let the Can we try enough times for in the stone round down the hill so gravity plus no

169
00:17:21,31 --> 00:17:28,37
roll snowball snowman. Now the interesting thing is you need to make that simple enough.

170
00:17:29,93 --> 00:17:36,47
And then but then when the snowman is able to build itself. This is in the magic this is when life stars.

171
00:17:36,75 --> 00:17:43,63
So what is the minimum thing you can do to make some think they can make itself. So what isn't.

172
00:17:43,64 --> 00:17:49,39
Is there is like how can you start the ball rolling quite literally. And this is so this is the bottom up.

173
00:17:50,96 --> 00:17:56,66
But that's very hard. We don't know where to search and you're quite right to be confused but.

174
00:17:57,71 --> 00:18:03,92
Is a big probably probability. I'm How many lottery tickets too I have to play until I win.

175
00:18:03,95 --> 00:18:10,16
So that's bottom up top down is me being control I'm building robots.

176
00:18:10,18 --> 00:18:14,77
That I will control to build everything like atom by atom.

177
00:18:15,46 --> 00:18:22,21
And what we do is we then asked every give the robot the instructions we give it some knowledge some information.

178
00:18:22,23 --> 00:18:28,54
So we say the robot and we say to one robot your dumb make a molecule make a snap make a snowman keep going.

179
00:18:28,71 --> 00:18:32,93
How many goes how many goes how many goes we take another I can't say he's a picture of a snowman.

180
00:18:33,44 --> 00:18:40,61
Make it so the robot cars are made ready. Then when we look at the robot you say OK that's really good snowman.

181
00:18:41,53 --> 00:18:45,55
We're now going to remove some of the information but we still want you to make a snowman.

182
00:18:45,88 --> 00:18:47,98
How much information can we take away.

183
00:18:48,07 --> 00:18:53,29
So this is like top down and what we're trying to do is work out how much information do we need to know.

184
00:18:54,74 --> 00:18:58,9
And how much can we find. And this whole concept of information in biology.

185
00:18:59,21 --> 00:19:07,23
So there's a bit like how much randomness can we use or how much complexity can we get from our environment

186
00:19:08,66 --> 00:19:20,02
and it just goes back to an observation about biology. Biology that all living things are made of cells..

187
00:19:16,87 --> 00:19:27,57
And in every cell. There is D.N.A. And the D.N.A. Allows the cell to evolve but no D.N.A. No evolution. D.N.A.

188
00:19:27,57 --> 00:19:30,43
Is complicated. So where did the D.N.A. Come from.

189
00:19:30,73 --> 00:19:34,55
So what we're trying to do is look at the robots to help us guess that.

190
00:19:35,22 --> 00:19:42,94
And that's what we do in the lab so we have two extremes we have the random class get lucky and no random.

191
00:19:43,08 --> 00:19:44,7
Let's Big Brother it.

192
00:19:44,86 --> 00:19:50,58
So we have like our big brother robot the videos everything and orchestrate so we have the conductor

193
00:19:50,58 --> 00:20:00,6
and we have the free form no conductor. And. So you go on the same time we.

194
00:20:00,69 --> 00:20:13,93
Going on in the group at the same time and we using common people to look at the experiments Yeah yeah so. Of.

195
00:20:13,95 --> 00:20:27,18
All right there is a problem here. With the lock. How you managed to direct the work. So he's a thing.

196
00:20:27,24 --> 00:20:35,63
One of the big time things that chemists are beginning to understand. It's like spread betting.

197
00:20:35,65 --> 00:20:38,49
Spread betting you go best you go on a horse.

198
00:20:38,8 --> 00:20:44,41
You can bet on the winner or the loser or you can spread on a variety of outcomes and say right.

199
00:20:44,66 --> 00:20:49,46
I'll get money that way. I won't make money as fast but I'll make money if your objective is like that. I give you.

200
00:20:49,47 --> 00:20:54,52
I don't know how many euro's or pounds I write your objective is to double your money in two hours.

201
00:20:54,84 --> 00:20:57,04
You could if you were lazy you could say right.

202
00:20:57,12 --> 00:21:07,13
All on one horse and you'd be dead or all when in very quickly when you say OK I'm not sure but I'll make a spread.

203
00:21:07,15 --> 00:21:14,22
And so one of the things that we try to do is look at how we can look at the distribution of different.

204
00:21:14,24 --> 00:21:21,87
How we can spread our luck. So you can do that by doing lots of things at once. So what I'm trying to say is.

205
00:21:22,56 --> 00:21:30,46
Time is the enemy. Because it to get lucky you need to wait times if you do want to time. It will take a long time.

206
00:21:30,66 --> 00:21:36,43
If you want to use the same amount of time we get lucky quickly you spread back in my lap.

207
00:21:36,59 --> 00:21:39,17
We don't have that much time so we spread bets like parallel.

208
00:21:39,67 --> 00:21:46,36
And what we're trying to do is to say OK we want to set up a series of random experiments.

209
00:21:46,38 --> 00:21:55,43
But we want to because we can because we could do the experiment in one big say a swimming pool sized reactor.

210
00:21:55,45 --> 00:22:02,21
Or we could do it in a very small cup or a test tube. We could do it in a smaller. If we have lots of small test tubes.

211
00:22:02,36 --> 00:22:09,29
Then we could do lots of different experiments in the same space as maybe at swimming pool so suddenly one swimming

212
00:22:09,29 --> 00:22:17,44
pool could be cut up into one million or even more test tubes. Suddenly we have a million goes where we had one.

213
00:22:17,45 --> 00:22:21,29
Now take into a droplet like an oil droplet you get in your salad dressing.

214
00:22:21,36 --> 00:22:26,74
And we to do all the experiments one oil droplet per experiment. Suddenly you can do it.

215
00:22:26,75 --> 00:22:29,3
Trillion experiments where you only have one.

216
00:22:29,4 --> 00:22:30,33
So you have a tremendous

217
00:22:31,55 --> 00:22:38,21
and then very quickly you can calculate how many times do I need to play the lottery before I get lucky and in the U.K.

218
00:22:38,21 --> 00:22:45,3
I think a few weeks ago to win the thirty three million probability I think was something like two hundred fifty six

219
00:22:45,3 --> 00:22:53,62
million to one CO with a trillion I can do that over four times here I go I win I have four top four chances of winning

220
00:22:53,62 --> 00:23:00,38
in that experiment and that is how we do it. Go all most important question that you.

221
00:23:01,34 --> 00:23:08,89
BLOCK OK that before I define life rotate if I'm going to find something else because it's really important to

222
00:23:08,89 --> 00:23:14,09
understand why definition is useful. Many scientists think that life cannot be defined.

223
00:23:15,15 --> 00:23:20,91
And I think that is unhelpful for trying to explain it to other people and also to try

224
00:23:20,91 --> 00:23:24,58
and get a concept because sometimes defining a concept we don't quite understand it.

225
00:23:24,8 --> 00:23:33,77
The one I like is flight imagine before humans flew they said write what is flight and you go outside.

226
00:23:33,94 --> 00:23:34,68
Look at birds fly.

227
00:23:34,77 --> 00:23:39,16
Maybe you might look at those squirrels that can glide or bumble bees

228
00:23:40,36 --> 00:23:46,12
and you can say OK this is I have this notion of flying there is some do work against gravity

229
00:23:46,12 --> 00:23:52,04
and they can move there and they go in the air but when the first airplane was made by the Wright brothers or whoever.

230
00:23:53,45 --> 00:24:02,03
They flew a few yards. That wasn't very far but then we went our flight is powered. Heavier than air travel.

231
00:24:03,34 --> 00:24:07,07
Not just balloon flying. And because I could go one hundred yards.

232
00:24:07,52 --> 00:24:11,49
Now I worked out how I could go a thousand yards and then

233
00:24:11,49 --> 00:24:13,88
when I'm in a thousand yards I want to cross the Atlantic before you know it.

234
00:24:13,88 --> 00:24:21,01
We got we know what flight is for me fly is getting on an airplane going up into the sky coming down again safely

235
00:24:21,01 --> 00:24:27,18
and being our travel several thousand miles in the air about touching down. And I think by framing it this way.

236
00:24:28,1 --> 00:24:33,57
If we define life in a similar way it might help us because now flight takes off in different forms.

237
00:24:33,61 --> 00:24:39,63
We have rockets we have planes we have gliders we have we may even have all sorts of other ways of doing helicopters.

238
00:24:40,78 --> 00:24:52,96
So when it comes to what life is life seems to be a an object when you feed it it reparative multiplies.

239
00:24:52,98 --> 00:25:00,92
And that's one thing at the start so I will start with a very general not very satisfactory concept

240
00:25:00,92 --> 00:25:12,11
but it's basically an object that takes stuff simple stuff from the outside as food and can make itself replicate.

241
00:25:12,12 --> 00:25:21,8
And a fancy a way of saying it is a self-sustaining. It's a bit like a flame that can feed itself thing.

242
00:25:23,46 --> 00:25:24,85
Basically that can evolve.

243
00:25:25,48 --> 00:25:38,54
But let's make it even more precise and just say life is a non-trivial self-sustaining thing in a big universe.

244
00:25:39,6 --> 00:25:47,99
Now let me there's a couple of scientific leap. So non-trivial means that it's not like sand. It's complicated.

245
00:25:49,44 --> 00:25:56,02
That means that you'd have to write down some lines in a book to write down what it is.

246
00:25:57,03 --> 00:26:01,13
Self-sustaining means it can keep going that non that complex. Keeps going.

247
00:26:02,29 --> 00:26:12,52
So it's a bit like say the storm on Jupiter has been working around for these thousands of years in the universe. So.

248
00:26:14,11 --> 00:26:21,22
Now can you see that life at that level to me has very little to do with chemistry and here is the problem.

249
00:26:21,46 --> 00:26:23,47
Lots of people who are trying to make

250
00:26:24,18 --> 00:26:30,36
or understand the origin of life are being very specific in their chemical archeology.

251
00:26:30,38 --> 00:26:37,68
But I'm just looking for a process. So I want to make the simplest object that will self sustain itself.

252
00:26:37,7 --> 00:26:47,07
Be complicated and go around the universe. So in my test tube I want to make a blob or a cell.

253
00:26:47,09 --> 00:26:50,00
That is able to make itself when you feed it food.

254
00:26:50,61 --> 00:26:57,83
And these complicated that just didn't just randomly arise because if I if I say life is salad dressing like I shake

255
00:26:57,83 --> 00:27:05,16
some vinegar and some oil when I get you know nice little Samik vinegar and I get this nice looking thing.

256
00:27:05,18 --> 00:27:11,36
Well that people say whether that looks like a life form but it doesn't make itself is not complicated.

257
00:27:11,7 --> 00:27:19,99
It doesn't doesn't act on itself a higher level definition of life. What I like in the end is like.

258
00:27:20,01 --> 00:27:28,93
Is one that can act on itself to change itself. What does that mean. Well I mail. I've got a headache. I can go.

259
00:27:29,62 --> 00:27:32,72
And I can pick up a pill and take it and cure my headache.

260
00:27:33,58 --> 00:27:40,33
So I can do something from the outside to the inside when you look in your environment. You don't think you don't see.

261
00:27:40,35 --> 00:27:50,86
Dead things purposefully moving around. So we call this agency is almost a bit like a self-awareness.

262
00:27:51,42 --> 00:27:59,35
So I sheep will go from grass to United to pasture to pasture a dog will go and follow its master or you know.

263
00:27:59,41 --> 00:28:03,81
So there's like this. Inputs. But I think they're quite complicated things.

264
00:28:04,05 --> 00:28:21,01
So I thought I do like this idea of a complex thing that self sustains in a big universe. So that that. Can also Yeah.

265
00:28:21,29 --> 00:28:23,5
So it copies itself over time.

266
00:28:23,73 --> 00:28:27,31
There's more of itself that basically take Rule materials and become more complicated

267
00:28:28,4 --> 00:28:33,91
and I guess these no these are notions it's a bit like flight because everyone had a thought everyone tends to fight

268
00:28:33,91 --> 00:28:36,1
about definitions of life because you know.

269
00:28:36,74 --> 00:28:41,92
We thought we could make a list of things right needs to evolve like Darwinian Darwin right.

270
00:28:42,19 --> 00:28:46,2
It needs to be based on carbon right. Nice to have water. Correct. Right.

271
00:28:46,22 --> 00:28:48,59
Nice to have a certain And then you get right this list

272
00:28:48,59 --> 00:28:53,29
and the problem is the list gets so long you forget why you're writing the list.

273
00:28:53,3 --> 00:28:58,15
And so I go back to fly and say well what is interesting about flight will for me I want to get on my airplane.

274
00:28:58,71 --> 00:29:05,59
I want to take off safely and travel several thousand miles touched our enemy. Get off refuel going. So although.

275
00:29:06,08 --> 00:29:08,07
So flight means something to us.

276
00:29:08,14 --> 00:29:15,42
So if I could make a new life form based upon different chemistry that would be really interesting because suddenly we

277
00:29:15,43 --> 00:29:18,19
don't have to say it's based on carbon or water.

278
00:29:18,21 --> 00:29:23,99
Because suddenly I'm now looking for a complex thing the self-sustaining and universe

279
00:29:23,99 --> 00:29:27,97
but it doesn't have to be based on carbon or water.

280
00:29:27,99 --> 00:29:32,34
And that's kind of where we're going at the moment and that is not a finished.

281
00:29:33,27 --> 00:29:39,98
Definition and it may never will be but think back to before flight before airplanes.

282
00:29:40,00 --> 00:29:47,67
We didn't have anything else to reference now we could all agree if we went to see some objects you know parachutist

283
00:29:47,67 --> 00:29:49,88
or whatever. What would be a lot of what would be flying or not.

284
00:29:50,06 --> 00:29:57,1
So I'm hoping that if we can make new life forms of different chemistry. It would help us under identify new life.

285
00:29:58,66 --> 00:30:02,06
Maybe there's other life forms on the earth very. Simple that we don't understand.

286
00:30:02,08 --> 00:30:11,38
We haven't recognized because they're too simple. We just ignore them for this very bad. Yes.

287
00:30:11,86 --> 00:30:15,56
I would I would say potentially but maybe not.

288
00:30:15,92 --> 00:30:23,55
I think maybe not but what we're doing is they're just prove you're right.

289
00:30:23,55 --> 00:30:25,8
Well I think there's a very important question.

290
00:30:26,49 --> 00:30:32,15
But what we're trying to do so many people are not are saying we need to design

291
00:30:33,03 --> 00:30:39,98
or we need to select a very special chemistry and only a very special chemistry gay it can lead to life and biology.

292
00:30:40,62 --> 00:30:48,16
So the very special chemistry living or origin of life and biology. I'm trying to say the other way around.

293
00:30:48,45 --> 00:30:56,22
Maybe the process is more important than the chemistry and the process selects the chemistry and he's become alive.

294
00:30:56,61 --> 00:31:02,87
Now Bearing that in mind. Suddenly we go to the lab now we suddenly free. We don't just have to use D.N.A.

295
00:31:03,81 --> 00:31:09,95
Amino acids the things that you find the biology we can use sand when you salt. We can use other stuff.

296
00:31:10,08 --> 00:31:17,1
So what we're trying to do is to take the simplest molecules the simplest chemicals and shake them together

297
00:31:18,11 --> 00:31:24,35
and look for evidence that they would become complicated. To start to become self-sustaining.

298
00:31:24,82 --> 00:31:27,3
We want to look for phenomena like forming.

299
00:31:27,78 --> 00:31:34,52
Cells would look for making machines look for evidence of complexity

300
00:31:35,65 --> 00:31:41,55
and so if I could basically take some very simple molecules and they would turn themselves into a cell.

301
00:31:42,17 --> 00:31:50,53
That could self replicate and look like a bacterial cell under a microscope then that would be really interesting

302
00:31:50,53 --> 00:32:00,22
and one of the. Well if you find them like this you know I'm no I don't know what Mo what so.

303
00:32:00,69 --> 00:32:02,25
No I don't have any clue

304
00:32:03,01 --> 00:32:10,83
but I think I'm right because I think well if I think if you think back to the the Earth early Earth was really crazy.

305
00:32:10,85 --> 00:32:13,11
Like every day that goes by. There's fire.

306
00:32:13,23 --> 00:32:20,62
There's brimstone those asteroids hitting the water's being evaporated there's lava coming out the energy is really

307
00:32:20,62 --> 00:32:28,02
high. So any really sexy sophisticated chemistry will be raised in a second or would be a raised.

308
00:32:28,51 --> 00:32:34,86
And this is my pick for me. That I saw you know maybe when I when I think about because I obviously like.

309
00:32:36,31 --> 00:32:41,52
Water because I'm in Scotland and it's raining all the time but you look at the river or in the sea

310
00:32:41,52 --> 00:32:45,55
and you look at patterns and things and they're only there for a small moment in time.

311
00:32:47,36 --> 00:32:56,06
So if the pattern was going to be a raised really quickly. Life is a pattern that doesn't get raised it takes.

312
00:32:57,74 --> 00:33:02,24
The outside and makes a pattern the makes more of itself and replicates that pattern

313
00:33:02,95 --> 00:33:04,78
and life is a bit like the Olympic flame.

314
00:33:06,21 --> 00:33:10,75
It's that that organization that goes from thing to thing to thing in time

315
00:33:10,75 --> 00:33:14,89
and space that never gets erased because it keeps being replicated.

316
00:33:16,34 --> 00:33:26,51
So if that could happen on earth I reasoned it has to be a happen much easier than we thought because otherwise the

317
00:33:26,51 --> 00:33:34,03
complex chemistry would be erased by the meteorite the water boiling the fire and brimstone some ice simple notion.

318
00:33:35,19 --> 00:33:41,45
If I'm being brutally honest really honest is that I don't pin really on this because I don't have any cognitive

319
00:33:41,45 --> 00:33:46,07
reserve is that I feel that life is far simpler than we could possibly imagine

320
00:33:47,04 --> 00:33:53,36
and I think we can recreate it in lots of different chemistries and there's no secret.

321
00:33:53,38 --> 00:34:00,62
There was lots of origins of life on planet Earth. One origin of biology that we know today. It's.

322
00:34:00,69 --> 00:34:05,9
Lots of roots there lots of ways to make a life form and they all converged and they cooperate

323
00:34:05,9 --> 00:34:13,02
and they ended up with D.N.A. and Proteins and ourselves as a compromise if you like between all the different.

324
00:34:14,65 --> 00:34:23,95
Extremes. You know. Minidisc player ipod tape cassette all these different technologies that were competing.

325
00:34:25,28 --> 00:34:31,1
It was the same in chemistry I think I believe I only say I believe I guess is a belief because it believes of those

326
00:34:31,1 --> 00:34:33,02
things that can't yet be test.

327
00:34:33,47 --> 00:34:39,48
And obviously I'm trying to turn that belief into a scientifically falsifiable set of experiments.

328
00:34:39,5 --> 00:34:41,69
And so we're going from two extremes.

329
00:34:41,8 --> 00:34:46,8
What I talk about top down with a robot doing it in the bottom up allowing it to happen and then videoing it.

330
00:34:47,75 --> 00:34:53,8
So that's what we're looking for we're looking for the simplest chemistry the can show evidence of becoming

331
00:34:53,8 --> 00:35:02,83
self-sustaining. And complex. So it's a bit like how simply can we make a fire.

332
00:35:02,85 --> 00:35:08,24
Able to go and find its own fuel but this fire has a pattern maybe it's not just a flame but it's a word

333
00:35:08,93 --> 00:35:14,88
and they say the word fire let's say the word fire can write fire and that word word fire became Pepco from.

334
00:35:15,44 --> 00:35:22,58
And that's what we're looking for in the lab. If that analogy makes sense you could try to think of a better way.

335
00:35:23,61 --> 00:35:28,77
Mason is very very very very right.

336
00:35:28,79 --> 00:35:39,67
Because of what was there and I'll leave you with this because of this element of complexity.

337
00:35:39,85 --> 00:36:06,76
So complex it is and then all these other courses and. Values all rules. So very much. But how do you. OK.

338
00:36:06,83 --> 00:36:12,98
He's got this. So I was just thinking about it.

339
00:36:13,00 --> 00:36:15,6
I was taught when you were talking as there is like extreme trial and error.

340
00:36:15,75 --> 00:36:20,5
I'll tell you something which I found when the most beautiful things are done as a parent

341
00:36:20,5 --> 00:36:26,63
or my wife was done as a parent it was a gift we were given. Which was basically grow your own butterfly.

342
00:36:26,65 --> 00:36:31,76
And so you have this kit where you have these things that turn in the capital and have them food and they go around

343
00:36:31,76 --> 00:36:34,86
and you watch them go for the process the caterpillars eat the food.

344
00:36:35,31 --> 00:36:40,14
They then make chrysalis and you put them in a you know they're all net and they go up.

345
00:36:40,52 --> 00:36:47,43
And they're ready and after some time the butterflies come out but when we did it. We had five.

346
00:36:47,45 --> 00:36:50,89
And we were really a motion the attacks and the kids are like look at this buffalo is coming

347
00:36:50,89 --> 00:36:58,01
but the fifth one got tangled in its way. It's like silk. And it never made it free.

348
00:36:58,03 --> 00:37:01,45
It died and we were so what we try to cut it free and grew so upset

349
00:37:02,51 --> 00:37:09,61
but they were like ah that's the perfect thing about life. It's trial and error. Those that survive continue.

350
00:37:10,19 --> 00:37:21,08
And if you think about. Trial and Error life is nothing more than matter that helps itself through trial and error.

351
00:37:21,09 --> 00:37:27,36
And is a bit like the selfish gene but it's more primal than that it's more simple. And support simply.

352
00:37:27,9 --> 00:37:38,72
What is the simplest sand or dirt or rocks that can help other rocks get better. And what is the definition of better.

353
00:37:39,36 --> 00:37:44,25
The problem with life that all the nice thing about life is you were talking earlier and it's complicated.

354
00:37:44,59 --> 00:37:46,79
Now but for something to be alive.

355
00:37:46,93 --> 00:37:54,94
It has to die and there's a kind of simple thing you will know when and let's say a bacterium is alive it's dead

356
00:37:54,94 --> 00:38:00,6
when it's dead it's no longer able to grow reproduce. You know with the bacteria if you feed it food.

357
00:38:00,69 --> 00:38:03,19
Every twenty minutes it splits into two into two into two

358
00:38:04,51 --> 00:38:08,81
and it's really interesting that that point of a bacterium this is imagine a bacterium

359
00:38:08,81 --> 00:38:10,27
and then in twenty minutes does this.

360
00:38:10,86 --> 00:38:17,73
So I ask you a question in your in your in your stomach in your intestine you have lovely bacteria that look after you

361
00:38:17,73 --> 00:38:23,77
or you have your bacteria whatever you want to call them your micro biome How old are the bacteria in your intestine.

362
00:38:25,2 --> 00:38:30,94
Area. I would say roughly three point nine billion years.

363
00:38:31,74 --> 00:38:37,47
Because that bacteria came from one bacteria that came from one bacteria came and there is

364
00:38:37,47 --> 00:38:47,13
and the limb picked thoughts of information passed back to what we called Luca the last universal common ancestor.

365
00:38:47,15 --> 00:38:51,95
In that wonderful the last universal common ancestor.

366
00:38:52,18 --> 00:39:00,33
It's from the cell from which all other cells on earth originated. It's that Olympic torch. That was then copied.

367
00:39:00,49 --> 00:39:06,65
But now wasn't just one of them picked taught it was carried from athlete to athlete they copied it. It was a bit like.

368
00:39:06,66 --> 00:39:12,38
Then suddenly copying a photograph or I don't know a a something that goes viral on the Internet.

369
00:39:12,41 --> 00:39:19,76
Everyone watching it so that bacteria in your intestine. Is. Billions of years old.

370
00:39:20,77 --> 00:39:26,1
You are billions of years old because where do you come from you come from your parents whether they come from their

371
00:39:26,1 --> 00:39:30,89
parents where they come from and then and for evolution before then maybe from their primates

372
00:39:30,89 --> 00:39:40,22
and then from there for that and all the way back. Is interesting that you persist in time but you die.

373
00:39:41,4 --> 00:39:41,67
And so

374
00:39:41,67 --> 00:39:47,43
and the case different from bacteria because they never quite die they they're like they split into two split into two

375
00:39:47,43 --> 00:39:48,74
but it's a change in cycle.

376
00:39:48,84 --> 00:39:53,42
So this is trial and error and so it's another way of summing up what's the minimum trial

377
00:39:53,42 --> 00:40:00,64
and error I can set up to carry on going. And I still I don't know I mean to be are you.

378
00:40:00,69 --> 00:40:08,11
You know what it means people say well what is it Michael. I kind of know what I'm looking for or know when I see it.

379
00:40:09,74 --> 00:40:13,88
But what I need to do right now is start with really simple chemistry in the lab.

380
00:40:15,03 --> 00:40:21,02
And I need to wash it like a hawk into suddenly something really odd happens and I go there.

381
00:40:21,18 --> 00:40:26,83
The events those events are responsible for the origin of life or maybe a new life form

382
00:40:26,83 --> 00:40:32,09
and so I guess it's really that is it. I mean what I'm doing exactly extrude remotely simple.

383
00:40:32,55 --> 00:40:36,13
I'm just playing dice keep rolling the dice rolling the dice.

384
00:40:36,44 --> 00:40:42,64
I want basically not just to get one six but six sixes in a row and then I want to keep going

385
00:40:42,64 --> 00:41:00,32
and I want to preserve the motion I'm the last play to get those six sixes in a row. OK so. Becky. How is your life.

386
00:41:00,34 --> 00:41:08,79
I mean I like you. Oh yeah yeah yeah. So we have a game or two ways.

387
00:41:08,81 --> 00:41:14,98
I because I do a lot of inorganic chemistry you want to get it to I I assemble really complex molecules from simple

388
00:41:14,98 --> 00:41:23,22
molecules and and the way I do this is I add acid to salt.

389
00:41:23,24 --> 00:41:27,88
And normally it's boring but in my lab we can make it be interesting.

390
00:41:28,04 --> 00:41:34,67
So that's what we're doing right now is we're looking at how to make the most complicated molecules with the least

391
00:41:34,67 --> 00:41:37,77
instructions.

392
00:41:38,63 --> 00:41:41,89
And with the robot the same we are giving it some chemistry to do

393
00:41:42,63 --> 00:41:46,92
but we're saying what about if we give you the least instructions what is the most interesting thing you can do with

394
00:41:46,92 --> 00:41:52,16
the least instructions and then when it does nothing. We should does at the moment say OK I give in.

395
00:41:52,18 --> 00:42:00,35
I give you the full instructions. What happens when you have all the instructions what can you then do.

396
00:42:00,69 --> 00:42:01,98
And then that's what we've done

397
00:42:01,98 --> 00:42:06,98
and we would show you this in the Brits have made a robot that you can give instructions

398
00:42:06,98 --> 00:42:14,8
and it makes really complex oil droplets that look like they're alive but they're not alive. They just move a lot.

399
00:42:14,94 --> 00:42:22,95
They were orchestrated it was a cheat a set up a bribe whatever. But then we say OK because we couldn't.

400
00:42:23,17 --> 00:42:27,99
When we know what instructions we needed to do to make the droplets look alive.

401
00:42:28,01 --> 00:42:37,21
How can we now move the information from the robot to the. Chemistry and it's a bit like this.

402
00:42:37,26 --> 00:42:46,64
We are saying we want the robot to write Shakespeare or the equivalent complex poetry song.

403
00:42:46,66 --> 00:42:51,55
Now because of robots dumb it doesn't know Shakespeare so we have to tell it Shakespeare so it just copies it

404
00:42:52,25 --> 00:42:57,83
and then if we blot out certain amounts of Shakespeare we say OK write Shakespeare with this small fragments.

405
00:42:58,24 --> 00:43:02,2
And they would say right OK Now you know know Shakespeare but learn a little bit of English

406
00:43:03,03 --> 00:43:07,00
and see if you can make something that sounds like Shakespeare what you need to go for it to make that

407
00:43:08,58 --> 00:43:15,34
and I think that's that's what we're trying to do I know it sounds kind of intangible is like still you kind of expect

408
00:43:15,34 --> 00:43:25,79
to me now. What we are doing in the lab which is even to start somewhere that.

409
00:43:25,81 --> 00:43:29,86
What we are doing in the lab to start somewhere. Simple as you say right.

410
00:43:29,88 --> 00:43:35,17
Biology is made up with carbon nitrogen oxygen hydrogen sulfur

411
00:43:35,91 --> 00:43:42,28
and some other metals what we're doing is we're putting these elements together and whiz up in them with electricity

412
00:43:42,28 --> 00:43:50,66
and we're heating them with them. What do they form. So we're taking hydrogen me thing ammonia and water.

413
00:43:51,12 --> 00:43:56,19
And we're doing a very classic experiment was first done in the night in fifty's called the million year experiment

414
00:43:56,95 --> 00:44:04,05
and they got two electrodes to simulate lightning and they got this simple. Soup and they heated it.

415
00:44:04,07 --> 00:44:09,89
Very simple very simple elements very simple molecules and what they got when they did it

416
00:44:10,9 --> 00:44:16,25
and they did it for four five days that in the end in that soup in the primordial soup they got some oil.

417
00:44:17,34 --> 00:44:23,21
So it looked like loopy crude oil but they saw some acids in it some molecules look like amino acids

418
00:44:24,17 --> 00:44:29,36
and they got really excited because I'm you know acids are what you find in biology in your proteins they are the

419
00:44:29,36 --> 00:44:37,67
simplest molecules. So when are the problem is solved. Just me for a nitrogen. You know so I'm just me.

420
00:44:37,7 --> 00:44:42,59
Fane and hydrogen an ammonia and some flame and some fire and you can make amino acids.

421
00:44:43,56 --> 00:44:50,36
But those amino acids are really simple and they're in really low concentrations there's a very small amount.

422
00:44:50,37 --> 00:44:58,72
So even though people have tried to since the night in fifty's were almost the last sixty five sixty six years people

423
00:44:58,73 --> 00:45:02,6
tried to turn those amino acids into pro teams and they have failed.

424
00:45:04,82 --> 00:45:11,42
What we've just done in the last year is we've made a robot that takes a simple Zimmy no acids

425
00:45:12,2 --> 00:45:20,08
and does random chemistry with amino acids and we've seen how primitive proteins can emerge.

426
00:45:20,1 --> 00:45:27,47
Or they're not proteins I must be honest. They're protein like but they can emerge from the random chemistry.

427
00:45:27,83 --> 00:45:34,32
Oh yeah we have a clue. And we used a robot to do it and I realized the question you're asking for survival.

428
00:45:34,37 --> 00:45:37,95
Like what you need sand and border sand on board of salt. What are you doing.

429
00:45:39,16 --> 00:45:48,82
Hydrogen carbon ammonia some flame amino acids really simple building blocks those building blocks.

430
00:45:49,06 --> 00:46:00,45
We then put into a robot to basically shake in a different way this very important thing is that we.

431
00:46:00,69 --> 00:46:09,31
Then take the material from the million year experiment which is just in a. In a in a vessel.

432
00:46:09,32 --> 00:46:10,29
And we

433
00:46:11,54 --> 00:46:20,2
and you then algorithm to order the to simulate lots of different environments because in a bell jar there was no sand

434
00:46:20,2 --> 00:46:24,19
there is no crust. It was just it was sanitized it was dead.

435
00:46:24,21 --> 00:46:31,19
It wasn't complicated enough the earth was quite complicated there minerals that's a surface that there was some

436
00:46:31,19 --> 00:46:37,34
atmosphere. So what we did is we put everything into different building blocks so it.

437
00:46:37,36 --> 00:46:41,93
Start again we put everything into different vessels and we treated it different way.

438
00:46:41,97 --> 00:46:45,83
So we did lots of random experiments and we looked for organization.

439
00:46:46,45 --> 00:46:53,55
So what we did was we made a massively parallel miliary combination. So we took the building blocks in the middle.

440
00:46:54,2 --> 00:46:59,47
And we divided it into literally a thousand different pots.

441
00:47:00,42 --> 00:47:06,35
This is like how do you make a cake from random recipe random ingredients Well you could randomly follow them go

442
00:47:06,35 --> 00:47:10,95
interest do one another and you make nothing or you could get somewhere where you make it go

443
00:47:10,95 --> 00:47:17,59
and then you say OK I'll put it into a thousand cake pots and put them in the oven and see which rise

444
00:47:17,59 --> 00:47:27,92
and select the ones which rise night and look nice and that's what we did. So like. Yeah it's exactly an enigma.

445
00:47:28,06 --> 00:47:31,04
You are. This is really good. So here's the thing.

446
00:47:31,69 --> 00:47:35,28
The Enigma Machine was a code breaking machine

447
00:47:35,28 --> 00:47:43,34
and I look like the origin of life is an enigma machine the code the code that came from the enemy was in the

448
00:47:43,34 --> 00:47:49,93
environment everyone can see it. But the sequence. The D.N.A. If you like was not known.

449
00:47:50,88 --> 00:47:59,7
So we had to happen to find that random code by guessing or to plug it in we plug it in we know the solution instantly.

450
00:48:00,69 --> 00:48:04,18
Or if we guess we have to take many many goats and that's exactly it.

451
00:48:04,29 --> 00:48:13,24
You could view the origin of life like an Enigma machine. And we just do not know the cipher. We don't know the key.

452
00:48:13,36 --> 00:48:14,69
Sorry to type in

453
00:48:15,49 --> 00:48:21,67
and actually I said this I said is to complex if arest he's interested in decryption encryption he said yes right.

454
00:48:21,89 --> 00:48:25,62
In fact if we know all the program on Earth.

455
00:48:25,64 --> 00:48:30,46
By knowing the life form or knowing how we can work backwards and work out the keys.

456
00:48:30,48 --> 00:48:35,11
And it's a bit like how you do encryption today. So you could do it like that.

457
00:48:35,43 --> 00:48:45,34
And so life suddenly even on a chemist life suddenly takes on a meaning that is not based in chemistry.

458
00:48:45,62 --> 00:48:54,42
It's information. What about what is now the magic information I can give you to go away and build a whole new society.

459
00:48:54,86 --> 00:49:00,96
So I sent you to Mars which one book which you take to make oxygen water.

460
00:49:01,32 --> 00:49:07,24
Have you seen the Martian maybe we should talk about films on this on the scene so.

461
00:49:07,84 --> 00:49:18,62
He's an interesting thing in the end the way human beings explain escape planet Earth is that they will send out robots

462
00:49:18,62 --> 00:49:20,56
that will go to other planets.

463
00:49:20,58 --> 00:49:22,03
And they will look for a source

464
00:49:22,95 --> 00:49:27,39
and they would turn that resource into a living hour of them to make more of itself to make a living machines

465
00:49:29,58 --> 00:49:48,23
and that's what we'll do. I guess. Make sure that you go in there and you know cook correct then to cheering.

466
00:49:48,25 --> 00:49:55,84
Well I mean a lot of the work we're doing is inspired by cheering I mean cheering. Given what has happened today.

467
00:49:55,92 --> 00:49:59,66
I'm not sure I want to talk of cheering and Boltzmann but I've committed suicide.

468
00:50:00,69 --> 00:50:03,89
Both men committed suicide because no one understood what he was talking about

469
00:50:03,89 --> 00:50:11,04
and was really shunned by the environment by the society cheering committed suicide for reasons or complicated.

470
00:50:11,2 --> 00:50:18,98
He was homosexual he was victimized he was bullied he was pushed out he had many way.

471
00:50:20,96 --> 00:50:25,22
But cheering really inspired both cheering and Boltzmann inspired me not because they committed suicide

472
00:50:26,34 --> 00:50:33,65
but because they really had very interesting handles on a very complex problem. Boltzmann talked about disorder.

473
00:50:33,94 --> 00:50:39,33
He knew about randomness. And he worked out this thing this measure of randomness called entropy.

474
00:50:39,76 --> 00:50:47,02
Basically my kids when they go into their bedroom they go. And if the entropy is high. It.

475
00:50:47,17 --> 00:50:53,04
If it's very random they've worked hard and made it random it's like what happens when he goes out if I go in

476
00:50:53,04 --> 00:50:55,57
and I order everything the ID Creasy entropy.

477
00:50:55,83 --> 00:51:00,33
So I then the nice thing when I decrease the entropy I give it a chance to be disordered Ika.

478
00:51:00,73 --> 00:51:02,41
Cheering understood this also.

479
00:51:02,58 --> 00:51:08,23
But in a different way he came up with an idea called morphogenesis and when I go running now

480
00:51:08,23 --> 00:51:10,56
when I'm thinking for years for me.

481
00:51:10,87 --> 00:51:17,83
What is inspired me and drives me and I think that because of course everyone says to me sometimes

482
00:51:17,83 --> 00:51:20,45
when they're making fun. I don't have any original ideas.

483
00:51:20,68 --> 00:51:26,48
I'm desperate to have an original idea maybe I haven't yet it's just a synthesis of other people's ideas for me I want

484
00:51:26,48 --> 00:51:30,04
to come up with chemistry that undergoes morphogenesis.

485
00:51:30,06 --> 00:51:37,52
So if I get a movie Genesis is like I'm an object that can change shape and change function but still be there

486
00:51:37,52 --> 00:51:40,34
but still be it itself.

487
00:51:40,36 --> 00:51:47,82
And I guess what are say to me maybe the viewer is like what is what defines yourself you would go out

488
00:51:47,82 --> 00:51:53,77
and look at a rock and say oh that's a self but you would go out and look at a deer or go or a child

489
00:51:53,77 --> 00:52:00,64
or an animal say oh that's a self that controls a living thing is a thing which can then actually observe.

490
00:52:00,69 --> 00:52:02,43
Itself and walk and talk and move.

491
00:52:03,34 --> 00:52:09,11
It's not only that because bacteria can't walk and talk and move in the same way they certainly move

492
00:52:09,11 --> 00:52:10,39
but it's more crude.

493
00:52:11,83 --> 00:52:16,83
So there is something interesting about what shearing thought about and decryption decryption and computers

494
00:52:16,83 --> 00:52:18,41
and robots and so on

495
00:52:18,41 --> 00:52:27,33
and in the end I'm pretty sure that human beings will be a make a robot that will be a make itself but and

496
00:52:27,33 --> 00:52:31,94
but I'm anxious that we don't forget the origin of life.

497
00:52:31,95 --> 00:52:39,2
Because one day maybe Rob Well maybe he's a story this imagine the human beings are long gone

498
00:52:40,17 --> 00:52:41,97
and there are only robots.

499
00:52:41,99 --> 00:52:46,6
And the robots make themselves and the robots go to another planet and there's a robot society

500
00:52:47,47 --> 00:52:59,64
and there's a supernova that raises the memory and the robot is forget where they come from where we come from.

501
00:52:59,89 --> 00:53:05,33
So they start the origin of robot life the grinding silicon chips up and because like where did the chip come from.

502
00:53:05,39 --> 00:53:07,85
It's not self assembling and they forgot.

503
00:53:08,12 --> 00:53:15,75
That they're a complex machine made by a more simple machine made by a more simple machine.

504
00:53:16,31 --> 00:53:20,87
And so if I can tell you anything today which I think for me I can't really justify

505
00:53:21,93 --> 00:53:31,83
but my feeling is life started with a minimal machine that can make a slightly more complicated machine that can make a

506
00:53:31,83 --> 00:53:36,55
slightly more complicated machine and so yes is turtles all the way down

507
00:53:36,55 --> 00:53:44,04
but they're simpler until the search the turtle right at the bottom is just sand and water and at the end we have.

508
00:53:44,05 --> 00:53:47,51
I don't know pornography.

509
00:53:48,35 --> 00:53:53,98
Well because art you know this is I can say I mean one of my friends who's looking at Robo Cop culture loss the

510
00:53:53,98 --> 00:53:59,38
ultimate. The ultimate form of a robot culture will be robot pornography that they all share.

511
00:54:00,69 --> 00:54:03,98
Maybe you don't want to put this in the main movie I don't know the main documentary.

512
00:54:04,3 --> 00:54:10,65
But I think your comment about cheering is very perceptive. I'm certainly inspired by him.

513
00:54:10,92 --> 00:54:15,29
I'm certain inspired by a lot of people that look to informatics I think one

514
00:54:15,29 --> 00:54:20,47
and I'm one of the third synthetic chemists to be sufficiently inspired by information

515
00:54:21,38 --> 00:54:29,23
and say How can I do the minimum. How can I come up with a minimum information but get the maximum chemistry.

516
00:54:29,59 --> 00:54:32,81
And whether the things we're doing and where we're going and how I kind of got to this is.

517
00:54:33,28 --> 00:54:37,45
We're trying to discover new drugs in my lap and make new drugs

518
00:54:38,16 --> 00:54:42,04
and if the viewer is completely confused about molecules and drugs and life.

519
00:54:42,2 --> 00:54:48,79
I'll give you one interesting thing I don't know if you know about the antibiotic problem.

520
00:54:49,97 --> 00:54:57,66
Can and are can be the drug they can out of Alvi using natural selection the drug doesn't use natural selection.

521
00:54:58,04 --> 00:55:03,7
So it relies on the human being to make a new drug in my lab one of the reasons why we want to make an artificial life

522
00:55:03,7 --> 00:55:09,66
form is if we can make drugs that are in competition with the bacteria and we say right.

523
00:55:10,57 --> 00:55:13,7
Here's a new but here's a new bacteria. Here's a new drug dead.

524
00:55:13,92 --> 00:55:19,52
Oh no of all of it and all we do now is there's no such thing as antibiotic.

525
00:55:19,89 --> 00:55:27,64
There's only a generation of new antibiotics that can be made under pressure. By the bacteria.

526
00:55:28,15 --> 00:55:37,63
So suddenly we change the entire concept of an adult a obsolescent drug no antibiotics become obsolete because we have

527
00:55:37,63 --> 00:55:42,8
an evolutionary machine. So at the very worst what we have made in my lab is not very good.

528
00:55:43,03 --> 00:55:45,08
So they get excited we haven't cured the problem

529
00:55:46,44 --> 00:55:52,44
but we have made an evolution machine that starts to show us how we can make some drugs evolve

530
00:55:53,23 --> 00:55:57,85
and be some antibiotics and when they are out of all the drugs we do it again and keep going

531
00:55:57,85 --> 00:56:06,7
and what our dream is to make a machine. They can evolve an endless infinite pipeline of drugs.

532
00:56:06,72 --> 00:56:08,3
And when we understand the process.

533
00:56:08,36 --> 00:56:15,64
Maybe we can understand how the life got started because it's an information based argument.

534
00:56:15,9 --> 00:56:21,44
You know I'm expressing myself Isn't it wonderful the universe exists look at the glorious things that happen.

535
00:56:22,15 --> 00:56:31,21
And one of the reasons why I'm doing what I'm doing is because I get I'm paid to Haas why. Or OK.

536
00:56:31,63 --> 00:56:41,98
Well isn't that a wonderful privilege. And that is one of the reasons why I try and engage. To tell people.

537
00:56:42,74 --> 00:56:47,82
And why are trying not to be arrogant about it because I don't feel a sense of arrogance I feel.

538
00:56:47,84 --> 00:56:56,32
I thought and where I come from is a sense of profound dumbness or a profound insecurity about understanding myself

539
00:56:56,32 --> 00:57:01,04
and why I'm here and but I'm I like to be creative.

540
00:57:03,14 --> 00:57:06,19
And so you know that's it's and it's a privilege to do it

541
00:57:06,19 --> 00:57:13,34
but if I can come up with like we talked about the antibiotics earlier and society excuse.

542
00:57:13,36 --> 00:57:19,77
Not to validate it but if I can turn the idea into something really cool that could change humanity or be useful.

543
00:57:19,93 --> 00:57:25,54
Then I think that's really excellent. And one of the things as what I want is obviously better.

544
00:57:26,00 --> 00:57:27,07
I want to solve the problem.

545
00:57:27,09 --> 00:57:31,57
I want to make sure I'm useful and I want to understand more about the process

546
00:57:31,57 --> 00:57:44,97
and so that it's all kind of in all complicated it's kind of what we're woven together. By one on one or one B. or.

547
00:57:44,98 --> 00:57:51,75
All I know when I was at school and. That.

548
00:57:52,15 --> 00:58:01,47
The teachers told me I was never going to really make it beyond anything I said you. Just not going to make it.

549
00:58:01,52 --> 00:58:06,85
You're not smart. They used to they used to say you're pretending to be smart.

550
00:58:06,89 --> 00:58:12,69
Stop pretending to be smart and those like will which means are you pretending to read my.

551
00:58:13,9 --> 00:58:18,64
Pretending to do math that we don't understand or you're pretending that we got the book at the library

552
00:58:18,64 --> 00:58:26,63
and they were like Stop trying to fool us like well surely it would be more effort to for you than just to do it.

553
00:58:26,82 --> 00:58:32,55
So if I was successfully following you wouldn't that be mean I'm even smarter than just being a I do it

554
00:58:32,55 --> 00:58:36,27
and they were like to go away.

555
00:58:36,28 --> 00:58:42,93
So so I I think that's one of the reasons why I can deal with imposter syndrome a lot of people in science

556
00:58:42,93 --> 00:58:48,3
or anything you're good at stuff athletes everybody. If I don't love us we're all impostors to some degree.

557
00:58:48,32 --> 00:58:52,86
I mean do we feel good enough to know that's what we're trying to better.

558
00:58:52,88 --> 00:59:01,24
And so I become comfortable about people telling me I'm not going to succeed. That doesn't mean I shouldn't try.

559
00:59:01,26 --> 00:59:07,4
So that's their right and I say no one thinks I'm going to succeed to make a new life form in my laboratory.

560
00:59:07,41 --> 00:59:15,47
I don't think you'll find anyone that believes I'm going to succeed but probably I will. And for the simple reason.

561
00:59:15,71 --> 00:59:16,97
Not for the complicated one.

562
00:59:18,13 --> 00:59:22,9
And the simple reason is because it's obvious and easy and not that complicated going on already.

563
00:59:22,92 --> 00:59:28,31
And not for that I am this magician who knows something they don't and I'm so incredibly smart

564
00:59:28,31 --> 00:59:36,83
and I'm this hidden genius that could clearly I'm not. But use. You all read my work.

565
00:59:37,35 --> 00:59:41,56
While I made a mistake a few years ago when I gave a talk at taiji know

566
00:59:41,56 --> 00:59:45,52
when you're trying to give this this TED Talks of the sound bite talks are privileged to give him great

567
00:59:46,3 --> 00:59:50,31
but you you feel like you want to time the time time bound it

568
00:59:50,31 --> 00:59:56,31
and I gave a time it would take once we knew what we were doing. I reckon we could do it quickly.

569
00:59:56,47 --> 01:00:03,74
You know year few years. But then that that kind of got missed. Understood as all you do in two or three or four years.

570
01:00:03,93 --> 01:00:13,06
I don't know. When we make progress in one two three four five ten years I would hope so. Can I put a limit on it.

571
01:00:13,18 --> 01:00:15,58
No because I don't want to raise expectations

572
01:00:17,08 --> 01:00:23,16
but I think right now it would be nice within the next ten years to know how hard the problem was.

573
01:00:23,6 --> 01:00:26,49
It or there's a if I can't do it in a decade or two.

574
01:00:27,91 --> 01:00:32,41
Or if I can't convince other people to help me because I think it's beyond me.

575
01:00:33,26 --> 01:00:36,91
I am not capable of solving this problem on my own that's what I've realized.

576
01:00:36,97 --> 01:00:44,8
But maybe I'm capable of building co-operative network to make a basically a large hadron collider of chemistry

577
01:00:45,75 --> 01:00:51,75
and I make a chemical Internet so that all chemists can explain explain their chemistry to each other

578
01:00:52,45 --> 01:00:57,56
and work together. If I can't do it but they can't do it and then so suddenly.

579
01:00:57,63 --> 01:01:03,65
I then crowd source chemistry through all my other labs and my competitors become co-operative

580
01:01:04,52 --> 01:01:07,94
and maybe that's a way of looking at it to turn it into a big corporate event and ever

581
01:01:07,94 --> 01:01:14,56
and we realize it's beyond one of us right. Right yeah yeah.

582
01:01:14,65 --> 01:01:22,51
Look I'm right I look like a OK if you want me to level with you. I can't tell you why I'm right I'm right.

583
01:01:22,52 --> 01:01:33,22
And the job my job is you quite rightly as a skeptic should go. No actually you're not right into you demonstrate.

584
01:01:33,23 --> 01:01:40,09
The theory the experiment and the critique and you carry on and you let everyone else judge

585
01:01:40,09 --> 01:01:43,06
and your peers will judge if you're right you won't.

586
01:01:43,67 --> 01:01:49,72
Your so in a way the nice thing for me is I like look I say I don't have to be right. I don't have to be wrong.

587
01:01:49,75 --> 01:01:50,85
I just have to do it.

588
01:01:51,92 --> 01:01:57,17
And I say here's my assumption here my experiments because you know what when people believe they're right

589
01:01:58,66 --> 01:02:03,55
and they just think everyone else is you know. How dare you give me a critic criticism.

590
01:02:03,83 --> 01:02:07,93
I'm right you're just too stupid to understand or you don't understand this

591
01:02:07,93 --> 01:02:11,85
or you don't know that there's something wrong. I see this all the time.

592
01:02:11,89 --> 01:02:22,16
So my job is to say on Asli as much as possible. Here are my starting points here. My rules for my experiment.

593
01:02:22,93 --> 01:02:30,19
Now are firm I die. Look how the experiment unfolds and all I want you to do is go wow that's interesting.

594
01:02:30,71 --> 01:02:36,1
If I can get you to do that doesn't matter. I'm right or wrong I will take a holiday or. It.

595
01:02:36,54 --> 01:02:38,95
Glory in discovery all I want to do more than anything else.

596
01:02:39,86 --> 01:02:47,14
The reason I'm doing this for a reason I think I'm right is I want to discover the process or the the phenomenon

597
01:02:47,86 --> 01:02:50,68
or the thing that it is that turns.

598
01:02:50,69 --> 01:02:58,78
Dead chemistry to live in chemistry enough for me so I suppose I know I'm going to discover something is probably more

599
01:02:58,78 --> 01:03:01,75
what I can say with certainty rather than I know I'm right.

600
01:03:01,77 --> 01:03:05,82
And that's what I guess I'm trying to say to be and in the end I don't know if I'm right.

601
01:03:05,96 --> 01:03:09,87
Maybe I will never be proven right or wrong in my lifetime because.

602
01:03:09,89 --> 01:03:13,12
We won't have the tools or I am I is an image

603
01:03:13,12 --> 01:03:18,22
but I lack the the intellect maybe I'm smart enough maybe the computers aren't fast enough.

604
01:03:18,33 --> 01:03:19,41
The time is not long enough.

605
01:03:20,68 --> 01:03:28,95
But if I can start with sand and turn into an object the starts to do something by itself when I feed it a field

606
01:03:30,13 --> 01:03:32,19
and you go wow this look at that again

607
01:03:34,54 --> 01:03:41,77
and you see that spark of life in that previously dead object that's really cool.

608
01:03:41,91 --> 01:03:44,18
What I think I might have been able to do.

609
01:03:44,47 --> 01:03:54,31
Is when they spark in life to set up those sparks of life those living things can do stuff that dead things can't do.

610
01:03:54,33 --> 01:04:00,13
And they make artefacts a bit like a caveman or me.

611
01:04:00,69 --> 01:04:05,04
Would make a complex object if you found in your backyard a thousand years later.

612
01:04:05,08 --> 01:04:09,21
Well naturally occurring or someone made that.

613
01:04:09,92 --> 01:04:17,93
I think I have come up with a thing an algorithm as I would call it a measure of made up ness.

614
01:04:18,53 --> 01:04:29,27
If I showed you a thing an object. You could tell me using my rules whether a living system a life form made it or not.

615
01:04:30,57 --> 01:04:35,08
And that is what I'm most excited about right now because that seems to be working in my head

616
01:04:35,08 --> 01:04:40,34
and I'm challenging it to all the skeptics I can find and they are trying to demolish it right now

617
01:04:40,34 --> 01:04:50,28
and I think they will get somewhere but there's something in it and your year to worry or you're right on time.

618
01:04:51,66 --> 01:04:52,32
You can cut that out.

619
01:04:52,48 --> 01:04:57,83
Depending on whether it works or not and a year's time and I think that in a year's time we will know.

620
01:04:57,86 --> 01:05:04,42
So if you bring me an object and. If you go to him if I go to Mars.

621
01:05:06,26 --> 01:05:10,97
He's my phone and you can see my phone's screen because my boys when they're young at the dentist

622
01:05:13,41 --> 01:05:17,92
and I find this on Mars. What you conclude if you go to Mars.

623
01:05:17,95 --> 01:05:25,9
You're the first person on Mars and you find one of these phones. What do you conclude.

624
01:05:25,92 --> 01:05:36,38
There you know is either a hoax I'm not the first one or a life form made a phone can't. It's why the one or the other.

625
01:05:36,96 --> 01:05:43,59
So now let's say we go to Mars and we find an object the so complicated. It doesn't exist on Earth.

626
01:05:44,8 --> 01:05:49,21
We've never seen it before is not an it's not evidence of Apple going galactic

627
01:05:49,21 --> 01:06:00,31
or so that was the solar system like solar Apple solar You heard it here. You know I just want I want money from Apple.

628
01:06:00,32 --> 01:06:03,61
I want. To pay me to go solar there may be a long bus can do that.

629
01:06:03,77 --> 01:06:10,28
If so if you can find a complicated enough these are called bio signatures.

630
01:06:10,3 --> 01:06:16,21
And what I've done is I think I've started to use it after written a new complexity theory me which I'm very proud of

631
01:06:16,21 --> 01:06:24,1
is that someone in school who was never any good at math apparently Well I'm obviously not that I've written a new

632
01:06:24,1 --> 01:06:27,19
complexity theory with my research team.

633
01:06:27,21 --> 01:06:32,87
And it seems to give us biasing machines to tell us when something is as complicated or improbable as a phone.

634
01:06:34,22 --> 01:06:36,95
You bring me a molecule in your hand.

635
01:06:40,17 --> 01:06:46,00
I can tell you by doing a number of simple things that molecule if it was made by a life form or not.

636
01:06:47,48 --> 01:06:56,13
How cool is that Equally if you say this house was this house made by a life form or not. Yes. Your car your phone.

637
01:06:56,15 --> 01:07:04,98
So now I have now got a hierarchy of complexity and now in the end I can define complexity by life by complexity.

638
01:07:05,59 --> 01:07:14,1
The necessary complexity is a bit like life form or that life is those things that can fro six die six sixes in a row.

639
01:07:15,00 --> 01:07:22,97
Every time you know if you just want it possible for you this go.

640
01:07:23,28 --> 01:07:34,43
This mathematics or this explanation for four out of a ninety dollars life or.

641
01:07:34,9 --> 01:07:48,22
Not intelligence evidence of come out of a life form not intelligence. Here's a way I did it. OK. It is it right.

642
01:07:48,24 --> 01:07:51,86
Cold or not. You know.

643
01:07:51,89 --> 01:07:54,79
No it's more is even more brilliant than that

644
01:07:54,79 --> 01:08:00,51
when I should say that it's even more simple than that I don't want to sound narcissistic on camera. It's even.

645
01:08:00,69 --> 01:08:07,3
More simple than the code. Because a code requirement. Already he said that molecules. It's more courses.

646
01:08:08,48 --> 01:08:13,7
And so Amalek than a know any molecule So if you bring a molecule to me.

647
01:08:13,86 --> 01:08:16,61
I don't want to give too much away it's not published yet

648
01:08:16,61 --> 01:08:20,74
but people should be thought it should be published will go well.

649
01:08:21,98 --> 01:08:27,15
I guess it's out there looking for something where you are drawing you all on your own.

650
01:08:27,8 --> 01:08:32,29
There is a fresh old there is a multi So here's the thing.

651
01:08:32,31 --> 01:08:36,92
When you add sand together you get certain patterns and you get those patterns will be simple.

652
01:08:37,8 --> 01:08:44,71
It's basically how many grains of sand I have to learn to get or to get a pattern that is not randomly possible

653
01:08:45,98 --> 01:08:50,99
and that is the beginning of the code in molecules if you imagine sand grains or atoms.

654
01:08:51,3 --> 01:08:57,68
When you fire them together they join. They'll be a certain pattern of atoms that when joined together.

655
01:08:57,69 --> 01:09:06,22
If you can find that in the environment. That cannot spontaneously form because it's just too improbable.

656
01:09:06,23 --> 01:09:19,61
And that is it all. I think. And I'm super excited because now I don't need to make life. Just make life.

657
01:09:19,7 --> 01:09:25,66
I need to make the simplest machine that can make the most complicated molecule.

658
01:09:25,68 --> 01:09:30,94
So now I'm like our I don't have to fly for the sake of it because flying no one flew for the sake of it.

659
01:09:31,05 --> 01:09:38,23
They flew because they wanted to be gravity and I want to get from London to New York. Now I have a reason.

660
01:09:39,56 --> 01:09:42,62
For doing it. That's really important. I have a reason for doing it.

661
01:09:42,63 --> 01:09:46,76
I can I can improve the complexity of the molecule.

662
01:09:47,06 --> 01:09:53,81
And more importantly than that more important is I can look on earth while Mars or Europa.

663
01:09:55,76 --> 01:09:59,87
And I can and I can see if I can find molecules on these planets.

664
01:10:00,69 --> 01:10:08,64
That are greater than the fresh told of naturally occurring and to see if there is Martians or Europeans.

665
01:10:08,65 --> 01:10:22,98
Because while I could argue that life on Earth is too sophisticated. So has become globalization..

666
01:10:17,03 --> 01:10:25,88
Let me tell you the ultimate globalization in life on earth D.N.A. Everyone has it how we boring we all have D.N.A.

667
01:10:26,59 --> 01:10:27,57
It's like McDonald's

668
01:10:27,57 --> 01:10:33,26
or got McDonald's look at the Golden Arches you'll have to have a thing called a ribozyme a rubber zone is a machine it

669
01:10:33,26 --> 01:10:36,1
turns your D.N.A. Information into the.

670
01:10:36,5 --> 01:10:43,44
Proteins how boring is that everybody's been globalized on Earth we all use the same thing.

671
01:10:43,54 --> 01:10:47,83
Wouldn't it be great if on Earth we found other life forms that didn't use D.N.A.

672
01:10:50,95 --> 01:10:56,58
Would it be great if one Europa and on Mars. We found other life forms that didn't use D.N.A.

673
01:10:56,59 --> 01:10:58,91
but They were still alive.

674
01:10:58,93 --> 01:11:04,22
They were above this fresh old and the only way we could recognize them is they were making really complex molecules

675
01:11:04,22 --> 01:11:06,74
and you talk about code the reason I got excited is.

676
01:11:08,03 --> 01:11:13,95
The reason why some of my friends in complexity science or are excited is what normally when you take any code

677
01:11:13,95 --> 01:11:18,88
or you take a picture you have to sign a code to it is abstract letters.

678
01:11:20,06 --> 01:11:27,16
Well for me the code is written in the periodic table the code is solved by the process of quantum mechanics the code

679
01:11:27,16 --> 01:11:33,69
is embedded in the laws of the universe. So their identity carbon or nitrogen oxygen or sulfur.

680
01:11:34,26 --> 01:11:42,03
They are implicit The code is already there. I don't add it on.

681
01:11:43,46 --> 01:11:49,69
So it means that the molecule that I think is complicated in on earth next to the sun.

682
01:11:50,34 --> 01:12:00,6
He's equally valid in Alpha Centuri a planet next to that and is a universal code if the code of complex molecules so.

683
01:12:00,69 --> 01:12:04,73
If I send a space probe to somewhere else in the universe and it finds a complex molecule.

684
01:12:06,1 --> 01:12:14,16
And it's different to what we know on Earth then we can assume that it formed by chance Of which there is no chance.

685
01:12:14,18 --> 01:12:19,76
I would explain that it's not just the take that's an assumption even if you don't believe me just say OK I will assume

686
01:12:19,76 --> 01:12:26,41
that Lee's assumption is correct if this molecule couldn't form by chance. And isn't come from a.

687
01:12:26,43 --> 01:12:47,36
A nother life or made it. That's it that's what we're looking for it's out. Really. Of course when you see. Thanks.

688
01:12:47,37 --> 01:12:53,54
Well. Oh well that me. Us.

689
01:12:55,32 --> 01:13:00,94
Well I think for me it will be if we succeed when we succeed

690
01:13:00,94 --> 01:13:10,87
when we succeed it will tell us that the universe has the propensity the ability to live. And the we are not a fluke.

691
01:13:10,89 --> 01:13:18,45
So that we can prove our highest huge sigh of relief to say you know why are our pathetic little lives has some meaning.

692
01:13:19,18 --> 01:13:23,81
We are here. Now what meaning what we impose the meaning on ourselves the universe just is right.

693
01:13:23,85 --> 01:13:30,04
I'm not looking for the meaning anywhere just is but then we can shift our entire problem to like saying OK.

694
01:13:30,18 --> 01:13:36,99
Life is easy. What about complex life. How easy is that.

695
01:13:37,01 --> 01:13:42,22
And let's just say someone along after I die it manages to do that and then say OK.

696
01:13:42,24 --> 01:13:49,7
What about intelligence how do you make that and what does that mean. And by this mind blowing.

697
01:13:49,78 --> 01:13:51,61
I mean I was so many steps I did.

698
01:13:51,62 --> 01:13:59,36
I'm I'm I'm a real practical guy I'm a chemist I love computers the reason why I got you know my son is nine years old.

699
01:13:59,62 --> 01:14:04,8
My oldest son. And last Saturday I did something that my father did for me when I was nine years old.

700
01:14:05,14 --> 01:14:06,9
He bought me a computer.

701
01:14:07,34 --> 01:14:08,17
So I took my son

702
01:14:08,17 --> 01:14:15,18
and I bought in the Raspberry Pi which is the well the the brick the best selling British computer ever

703
01:14:15,18 --> 01:14:18,33
and I have to be true to British computer science because it's a legend.

704
01:14:19,24 --> 01:14:26,39
I had a six a one I bought him this reply we had a nice case of the keyboard so he took his programming basic he's

705
01:14:26,39 --> 01:14:27,89
addicted this hilarious.

706
01:14:27,91 --> 01:14:30,51
And one of the things I loved about when I grew up you know

707
01:14:30,51 --> 01:14:41,09
when I was nine ten eleven years old that the teachers were saying I was stupid.

708
01:14:35,47 --> 01:14:40,25
but I was programming I was using assembly and trying to get as many programs into one K.

709
01:14:41,11 --> 01:14:53,07
I was fascinated I needed one killer by how much mayhem could I cause with one killer bike..

710
01:14:47,61 --> 01:14:52,31
So for me it was like compression. How could I compress as much potential mayhem in one K.

711
01:14:53,09 --> 01:15:00,71
And that's why I became obsessed with complex ability complexity ability. That's a new word compression and complexity.

712
01:15:00,95 --> 01:15:14,15
How much mayhem can I. Compact into a small box. How do you. You get yourself. On.

713
01:15:14,16 --> 01:15:32,77
Going crazy because all of us have years. That is like life. Diet pills. Well I mean thinking about this.

714
01:15:32,95 --> 01:15:39,41
Just balance your. I've always been balance from the beginning. I'm always a little bit on there.

715
01:15:39,56 --> 01:15:42,44
The weird side in terms of I'm a little bit extrovert but

716
01:15:42,44 --> 01:15:49,02
but my family my I may sound my family came before my science. OK I mean all I care.

717
01:15:49,03 --> 01:15:52,12
Talk about as a child but my progress into academia.

718
01:15:53,65 --> 01:15:59,05
I was married before I was a professor I was married before then and my wife is one of the smartest people I know

719
01:15:59,05 --> 01:16:06,72
and she kind of he said this may. Yeah why ever. Now go. Do the washing up or.

720
01:16:06,74 --> 01:16:09,75
Yeah you may be smart because she has appears the in fundamental mind ism.

721
01:16:10,39 --> 01:16:14,61
So it's kind of grounding in a way in magnetism quantum magnetism.

722
01:16:15,03 --> 01:16:21,28
So she was trying to understand how little magnets could order and undergo phase transitions.

723
01:16:22,07 --> 01:16:28,05
And long distance and so and you know like me she was an interesting.

724
01:16:28,28 --> 01:16:31,31
She was she was opposite at school she was in a poor school

725
01:16:31,31 --> 01:16:34,5
but the genius at school so you know thought she walked on water.

726
01:16:34,79 --> 01:16:39,49
So she was told she was a genius when I was told I was in my own genius at school.

727
01:16:39,51 --> 01:16:44,44
So I don't know and we met we met on a crystallography course Actually one.

728
01:16:44,83 --> 01:16:54,15
Course which is like a science course understanding X. Ray diffraction. Years and years ago. I don't know. I suppose.

729
01:16:54,86 --> 01:17:00,86
I've never been I'm out there real chemistry I guess I mean.

730
01:17:01,99 --> 01:17:05,79
I don't know there's something intrinsically grounded in my prime of practice it's practical.

731
01:17:06,15 --> 01:17:09,79
I think the I guess he's the reason why it's grounded it's all very practical.

732
01:17:10,09 --> 01:17:13,46
It's like a lot of people go crazy because it becomes more and more abstract

733
01:17:13,46 --> 01:17:19,08
and like oh you can't possibly understand how complicated it is in my head and all this and yet probably you can

734
01:17:19,08 --> 01:17:21,44
and probably you can but at the end of the day

735
01:17:22,57 --> 01:17:26,58
and this is why one of the things I'm doing my research group at the most I'm really privileged to have some really

736
01:17:26,58 --> 01:17:32,63
smart people. And their challenge. There I probably can't use the word retard.

737
01:17:33,00 --> 01:17:40,8
In America or somebody says the stupid person in the group is me. If they can explain to me what they've done.

738
01:17:42,01 --> 01:17:43,34
I can't write the paper with them

739
01:17:44,27 --> 01:17:48,53
and I can't raise the money with them because I'm not just sitting in my office waiting for a paper

740
01:17:48,53 --> 01:17:55,81
and waiting for money. I want to do my science I'm addicted to chemistry. I mean what do you do that.

741
01:17:55,9 --> 01:18:05,83
Well I mean I'm going I'm going to balance. Your own life. Yeah well it's very practical use.

742
01:18:07,15 --> 01:18:11,97
You know everyone said I mean a few weeks ago I remember being interviewed by someone else the same question I used to

743
01:18:11,97 --> 01:18:12,94
have a listening idea or this

744
01:18:12,94 --> 01:18:18,36
and I was like how they do anything else I sleep four hours a day I work the rest spend some time with family

745
01:18:19,38 --> 01:18:25,21
and it's not quite as severe as all that but what I'm saying let me finish one point the first point is very practical.

746
01:18:25,27 --> 01:18:30,09
So the problems are very practical like you're having deep thoughts and then your glass breaks

747
01:18:30,09 --> 01:18:33,91
and there's water everywhere in this crap everywhere it's like you've got it. You've got to clean it up.

748
01:18:34,18 --> 01:18:42,96
That's one thing. At home. Well I like to watch television with my wife we like fiction. I run every day.

749
01:18:44,81 --> 01:18:50,45
And I've got two kids and I like to do stuff with them and I like them to challenge me and

750
01:18:50,45 --> 01:18:54,71
and as much as I'm always busy because I'm trying to raise money and writing papers and like that.

751
01:18:54,74 --> 01:18:56,31
C'mon you know they're getting older.

752
01:18:56,45 --> 01:18:58,74
They're only going to be this age for a little while

753
01:18:58,74 --> 01:19:03,94
and so I was fortunate enough to have children a time in my life where everything could have gone off the rails.

754
01:19:04,18 --> 01:19:11,3
But they bring you back. There's nothing a like a kid vomiting on your shoulder or telling you you know you come here.

755
01:19:11,83 --> 01:19:16,72
You come in was a brilliant idea. And we could just go in there. Not interesting.

756
01:19:16,87 --> 01:19:19,95
And it's quite funny because I like they don't know.

757
01:19:20,95 --> 01:19:27,95
OK OK to me one of them says something odd that they're smart and that just really interesting

758
01:19:27,95 --> 01:19:33,76
and I'm interested in them. But so. I've been hobbies Well I do a lot.

759
01:19:33,84 --> 01:19:37,83
I love computers I love technology I love hacking around.

760
01:19:37,84 --> 01:19:44,93
Well yeah I mean the fact is I mean you're trying to say that I you know pain or handle I don't I don't. I just.
