1
00:00:00,73 --> 00:00:02,07
My name's Nicky Clayton

2
00:00:02,3 --> 00:00:09,47
and I'm professor of comparative cognition at the University of Cambridge in the Psychology Department.

3
00:00:09,93 --> 00:00:15,17
I'm also scientist in residence at one bed and dance company in London and.

4
00:00:16,32 --> 00:00:23,08
When they're doing well it's the name OUR I am being sets it was called Ballet around there originally

5
00:00:23,08 --> 00:00:24,75
and then it became a dance company.

6
00:00:25,43 --> 00:00:31,45
And most recently they can use the name again to just from their own time because it dances around an orchestra.

7
00:00:32,76 --> 00:00:39,38
And it's nineteen years old this year we've just celebrated our ninety's Bester. Really.

8
00:00:39,7 --> 00:00:49,38
But you have a scientist in residence at a ballet thought that correct. Well Palin Complete don't want one.

9
00:00:49,43 --> 00:00:50,47
You don't need a scientist.

10
00:00:51,02 --> 00:00:59,99
Well I do things but mainly I collaborate with Mark Baldwin who is a Korea world famous choreographer

11
00:00:59,99 --> 00:01:05,92
and artistic director of the company and we've worked on five corridor for works together.

12
00:01:06,66 --> 00:01:14,83
One about evolution called the Committee of change one that was about crows and children and the power play.

13
00:01:15,29 --> 00:01:22,37
Called sudden for secret ever to be told one about sexual conflict which was called what the X. To see.

14
00:01:23,26 --> 00:01:33,21
So that's three of them and the most recent one that we're doing which will premiere shortly in July.

15
00:01:33,23 --> 00:01:38,96
In fact is called the creation based on Haydn's creation it's about the origin of life and the origin of time.

16
00:01:39,19 --> 00:01:45,41
So it's very movement based. So that's some of the sorts of things that we do.

17
00:01:45,95 --> 00:01:52,13
Company and also work with some of the dancers on their individual choreograph projects. OK so what.

18
00:01:52,14 --> 00:01:59,94
So what works when you put the emphasis on the science all of that. Because the integration of the chain. It's.

19
00:02:00,09 --> 00:02:09,85
About using ideas from science to inspire you. Choreograph it works. So it's quite an interesting thing to do and.

20
00:02:10,88 --> 00:02:15,86
Clive Wilkins with you my collaborator and I captured gotten stronger.

21
00:02:16,38 --> 00:02:24,37
We were a tad paper together with another of my colleagues Kevin Leyland on the evolution of dance which was published

22
00:02:24,37 --> 00:02:26,07
quite recently in Current Biology.

23
00:02:26,65 --> 00:02:34,66
So all the work is interrelated it's about I suppose I'm a movement junkie really and I love to move I love to dance

24
00:02:34,66 --> 00:02:44,21
and my science and art is really inspired by my love of dance and well of. Because I've always wanted to be a bad.

25
00:02:44,33 --> 00:02:50,78
I've always wanted to fly. And I have invisible when you know that you can see that.

26
00:02:50,83 --> 00:03:07,3
Yeah well let me go back to your professor at University. So so what can you tell me what. What exactly is your.

27
00:03:09,57 --> 00:03:11,03
Department.

28
00:03:11,48 --> 00:03:19,63
What do you do while I'm based in the department of psychology these days although my training initially was in

29
00:03:19,63 --> 00:03:22,38
sewerage and so I read silage year to Oxford University

30
00:03:22,38 --> 00:03:27,25
but I've always been interested in the interface between biology

31
00:03:27,25 --> 00:03:31,54
and psychology because I'm interested in how they stink.

32
00:03:32,31 --> 00:03:35,92
So they'd say logical aspect of it is because of the beds

33
00:03:35,92 --> 00:03:40,73
and the psychological aspect which is that I'm interested in cognition

34
00:03:40,73 --> 00:03:47,46
and I'm interested in what's it like to think without words as well as what it's like to think with words which is

35
00:03:47,46 --> 00:03:53,36
something to explore scientifically in terms of the ability of birds in general

36
00:03:53,36 --> 00:04:04,46
and members of the crow family in particular and their cognitive abilities their problems. Solving. So so your.

37
00:04:06,22 --> 00:04:11,76
It's resin comes from. So why don't you. When I and the only other part from psychology.

38
00:04:12,01 --> 00:04:12,28
You know

39
00:04:13,23 --> 00:04:21,62
and you combine it with trying to find out how birds can think well crows in particular because crows are extremely

40
00:04:21,62 --> 00:04:28,44
intelligent you've got huge brains for their body size relative to body size their brains yours are just those pansies.

41
00:04:29,01 --> 00:04:38,79
And we know that they are extremely good problem solvers. The kinds of things that I've been investigating are.

42
00:04:40,95 --> 00:04:45,6
Whether these birds are capable of remembering the past and thinking about the future.

43
00:04:46,1 --> 00:04:50,5
So in other ways can they like us mentally travel backwards

44
00:04:50,5 --> 00:05:00,83
and forwards in time to remember specific past separate sets and to imagine one crucial plan for future scenarios.

45
00:05:01,19 --> 00:05:07,51
OK let me go back to define first what was it in your opinion is and.

46
00:05:09,92 --> 00:05:19,73
Without thinking about birds but what do you think is thinking. Well.

47
00:05:21,12 --> 00:05:26,25
I would define cognition as the ability to problem solve.

48
00:05:26,82 --> 00:05:36,27
And it involves a series of scales that the kinds of things that I would I would want to include would be mental time

49
00:05:36,27 --> 00:05:42,35
travel. And theory of mind. So these two skills are related.

50
00:05:42,39 --> 00:05:47,93
So mental time travel is about being able to think about other times so times other than the hearing now.

51
00:05:48,12 --> 00:05:53,89
Hence past and future and Theory of Mind is the ability to think about other nine S.

52
00:05:53,89 --> 00:05:59,92
So I if I have theory of mind then I can understand that your perspective.

53
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:05,65
It will be similar to mine in some regards but in other ways it will be crucially different

54
00:06:05,98 --> 00:06:12,41
and the idea that I could put myself in your shoes and imagine what your thinking would be theory of mind.

55
00:06:12,46 --> 00:06:13,56
So I think two important.

56
00:06:14,6 --> 00:06:24,08
Thinking skills you have a thinking skills but when you want the fine work is thinking what is the.

57
00:06:24,64 --> 00:06:30,03
Well as I've said I thought oh I'm starving. This problem solving and so on. What is a thought.

58
00:06:30,05 --> 00:06:39,01
So a soft is the ability to project the nine. So the problem with just defining problem solving.

59
00:06:39,06 --> 00:06:45,43
As I could settle on one problem I've got here is I'm thirsty. I want to pick up this cup to drink the water.

60
00:06:45,46 --> 00:06:52,93
Now you can say that the ability to hold the car can do this allows me to solve the problem of being thirsty.

61
00:06:53,23 --> 00:06:55,32
Well that's a physical task

62
00:06:55,32 --> 00:07:03,13
but that the point about thinking is that you can play multiple scenarios in the mind without actually executing the

63
00:07:03,13 --> 00:07:10,2
class first so are having never encountered this kind of object before they're able to think through in the mind's eye

64
00:07:10,2 --> 00:07:18,46
without taking any action. What is the minimal amount of things I need to do in order to drink the water.

65
00:07:18,49 --> 00:07:20,9
So for example with the birds.

66
00:07:20,92 --> 00:07:27,82
We have our own water task that involves something similar to this we call it the atoms fable because it's based on the

67
00:07:27,82 --> 00:07:30,54
Arabs fable of the thirsty crow in the picture

68
00:07:30,54 --> 00:07:37,62
and in the fable of course a crow encounters are a picture of water the water level is too low

69
00:07:37,62 --> 00:07:42,97
and so it's it's not within reach and what Crowder's says she found some stones

70
00:07:42,97 --> 00:07:49,02
and puts a sense into the picture to raise the water level to a level at which she can drink.

71
00:07:50,00 --> 00:07:56,74
So we can do something similar with our we can present them with a Chub that's got some water in the water level is too

72
00:07:56,74 --> 00:08:03,63
low for the bird to just be able to go and reach the water. In fact in our case we don't make the birds thirsty.

73
00:08:03,7 --> 00:08:08,74
We floated little tasty worm on top of the water now works well

74
00:08:08,74 --> 00:08:13,26
and a wax moth larvae as they're properly called a zero on a test

75
00:08:13,64 --> 00:08:18,51
or the Belgian truffles of they called it well they really really love these

76
00:08:18,51 --> 00:08:21,79
and so then highly motivated to get these worms

77
00:08:21,79 --> 00:08:24,89
and of course the worms are out of the reach because the water levels too low.

78
00:08:25,82 --> 00:08:33,00
And they bed spontaneously stones into the water level to raise water.

79
00:08:33,93 --> 00:08:41,00
We can then use a task like that a basic problem solving task as well. How are the birds thinking through this problem.

80
00:08:41,01 --> 00:08:48,53
How can they solve these things so for example we could have a series of tubes only one of which contains water.

81
00:08:48,77 --> 00:08:52,72
Maybe in another condition the worm is floating in air.

82
00:08:52,73 --> 00:08:59,57
Thanks to a bit of blue tap rather than real magic and in another one the worm is resting on a solid say sound

83
00:08:59,57 --> 00:09:06,98
and we can ask whether the birds understand that there's no point putting stones into a cheaper lair

84
00:09:06,98 --> 00:09:14,14
or too full of sand that's not going to change the level of the substrate it's only going to work with the liquid with

85
00:09:14,14 --> 00:09:14,6
the water.

86
00:09:14,63 --> 00:09:19,39
Similarly we can give them the choice of different kinds of objects to put into the tube

87
00:09:19,39 --> 00:09:26,19
and asked whether they understand that it's heavy ones sink that are actually going to displace the water

88
00:09:26,19 --> 00:09:32,58
and therefore. Allow the water level to rise to a level at which they can then reach the worm.

89
00:09:32,65 --> 00:09:38,42
Whereas if they are hollow ones in the ones that use float. That's not going to displace them.

90
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:44,35
So we can do various tests like that to see how they're thinking through the problem

91
00:09:44,35 --> 00:09:51,46
and that's our way of trying to get it how they can solve these problems and what they understand about the task.

92
00:09:51,66 --> 00:09:59,77
But there you are talking about the core of it thermally I'm talking about Howard and Jerry is.

93
00:10:00,73 --> 00:10:06,82
Roxanne you get an incredible one hundred languages Yeah but that's as an example you asked me.

94
00:10:07,35 --> 00:10:14,19
There isn't a set definition you know I can't give you four words that nails down what thinking is because if I try

95
00:10:14,19 --> 00:10:20,73
and do that there's going to be too many caveats to it you know given all that's why I want to start to think out loud

96
00:10:20,73 --> 00:10:24,00
what could possibly be so that's why I think problem solving.

97
00:10:24,00 --> 00:10:29,58
But one in which you can have sort of internal trial and error and think through a problem is concerned.

98
00:10:29,84 --> 00:10:34,54
Yeah yeah well that's interesting for me sort of first I would like to try to find out.

99
00:10:34,65 --> 00:10:37,61
Well what what the area we're talking about and after that.

100
00:10:37,97 --> 00:10:45,64
I would like to talk with you about how do you do your research with. Crows and with young children.

101
00:10:45,97 --> 00:10:48,36
So I think one different sort of really.

102
00:10:48,63 --> 00:10:55,14
Not everything about thinking and cognition is very clear to me because our audience is well educated

103
00:10:55,14 --> 00:11:04,9
but they are not scientists so. That's why we have to do to. Talk a little bit about what are we talking about.

104
00:11:05,12 --> 00:11:09,22
Yes well in the reason I say gave problem solving said

105
00:11:09,22 --> 00:11:12,73
but there are simple ways of problem solving that I wouldn't call thinking.

106
00:11:13,01 --> 00:11:16,31
Would be you could imagine you just do something through trial

107
00:11:16,31 --> 00:11:21,26
and error so you know you've no idea what this is it's a novel object and push it this way

108
00:11:21,26 --> 00:11:23,59
and that doesn't work you need to do that.

109
00:11:23,66 --> 00:11:30,45
Lots where can eventually through exploring a number of things you figure out that the best way to get a cup

110
00:11:30,45 --> 00:11:36,2
and drink is to do that action and then they're after you just do more of the same.

111
00:11:36,27 --> 00:11:42,44
Well that's called learning by trial and error or instrumental conditioning is what a psychologist would call that

112
00:11:42,44 --> 00:11:51,02
and most people wouldn't want to call any problem solving that simply occurred through learning by trial

113
00:11:51,02 --> 00:11:55,92
and error more instrumental conditioning cognition they would want to say that cognition.

114
00:11:56,52 --> 00:11:59,78
Requires more than that it's the ability to actually sinks.

115
00:12:00,38 --> 00:12:05,9
A problem without necessarily having to you to learn about the outcomes first.

116
00:12:05,94 --> 00:12:15,42
So that's why I've used that example as a as a distinction so what you usually looking for is to train your animal

117
00:12:15,71 --> 00:12:18,9
human subject on a particular task until they're doing it

118
00:12:19,39 --> 00:12:25,49
and then you do some kind of transfer test which really what you're tapping into is what are they understood.

119
00:12:26,26 --> 00:12:35,01
And how they do something more than just simple learning by rote can they obstruct some sort of general rule that tells

120
00:12:35,01 --> 00:12:40,6
you that yes that they're actually thinking about it and it's not automatically doing it here

121
00:12:40,6 --> 00:12:47,4
or are you so interesting interested in the circular. About how this works in your mind.

122
00:12:50,41 --> 00:12:54,6
Well I suppose I'm fascinated by thinking and say.

123
00:12:55,26 --> 00:13:02,94
And at one level I'm really interested in the different kinds of saw processes that.

124
00:13:05,4 --> 00:13:12,57
Go on and the extent to which they rely on words or don't rely on words so.

125
00:13:13,57 --> 00:13:18,78
I say words rather than language because of course in humans we have language.

126
00:13:20,09 --> 00:13:23,75
And sometimes we think without using words

127
00:13:23,75 --> 00:13:29,79
but I wouldn't want to say that that's without language because it's not like each take the bits of the brain that are

128
00:13:29,79 --> 00:13:34,00
responsible for language on screen about the brain put them on the side and carry on.

129
00:13:34,07 --> 00:13:42,36
You're still all your linguistic skills contribute to all your cell processes with and without words

130
00:13:42,36 --> 00:13:46,19
but the whole idea that we might be able to the sum to which.

131
00:13:48,03 --> 00:13:50,58
Words enrich our thought

132
00:13:50,58 --> 00:13:59,77
but perhaps even more intriguingly the extent to which they can constrain also so I think it's a fascinating area to do.

133
00:14:00,23 --> 00:14:09,38
If you meant you expressed. My thinking without words. What kind of.

134
00:14:09,73 --> 00:14:18,95
Well ways of thinking contemporary dance visual art are both examples of thinking without words

135
00:14:19,12 --> 00:14:25,09
or thinking largely without words when you see a beautiful painting it doesn't usually have words on it

136
00:14:25,86 --> 00:14:30,34
and even if it does have a word on it like the famous this is not apparent.

137
00:14:31,94 --> 00:14:35,61
Even then that the point is so much more than just the words right.

138
00:14:35,8 --> 00:14:46,6
And similarly in contemporary dance you see a beautiful. Series of movements. But words are really secondary.

139
00:14:47,38 --> 00:14:55,47
Yes it's quite a title and yes there might be a small description in the program but the performance is so much more

140
00:14:56,12 --> 00:15:03,62
or do you do magic in fact that it's also largely without words I mean the patter that goes with the in fact is just a

141
00:15:03,62 --> 00:15:07,85
small part of the at the at the bits that everybody gets.

142
00:15:08,99 --> 00:15:16,35
Is when something unexpected happens when you realize that you can't possibly have seen what you thought you saw

143
00:15:16,88 --> 00:15:27,22
or you must have not seen what really happened. Cybele Weisser those juxtapositions the beautiful painting.

144
00:15:27,25 --> 00:15:36,15
Is this the artist had a thought and you try to express it in government again yesterday

145
00:15:36,15 --> 00:15:42,95
and then the way in which you don't wonder what things artists actually saw what they actually saw

146
00:15:42,98 --> 00:15:51,32
and why they chose to represent it in that particular way. So. You know Alan even with words.

147
00:15:51,36 --> 00:15:59,89
I mean I think there's an interesting difference between scientific writing and literary artistic writing big.

148
00:16:00,01 --> 00:16:06,3
As in scientific writing you want to make everything is on ambiguous as possible because the whole point of a

149
00:16:06,3 --> 00:16:13,01
scientific paper is that strictly speaking anybody should be able to read the method section of their paper

150
00:16:13,26 --> 00:16:15,41
and if they had the right skills

151
00:16:15,41 --> 00:16:22,49
and facilities they should be able to replicate the funding so in a scientific paper you want to make everything.

152
00:16:23,19 --> 00:16:29,1
As an ambiguous and clear as possible but very often in military writing.

153
00:16:30,64 --> 00:16:36,98
You want to make it ambiguous because you want layers to it. You want the words not to be self-explanatory.

154
00:16:37,32 --> 00:16:39,85
But to generate needful.

155
00:16:41,01 --> 00:16:47,94
And the less I think that is an interesting contrast so you know way I think in really good literature

156
00:16:47,94 --> 00:16:54,26
and the words are almost being used in the way.

157
00:16:54,31 --> 00:17:00,63
No used by a composer to you know create a beautiful story to build which layers of.

158
00:17:02,36 --> 00:17:10,82
Atmosphere much of which is largely wordless wordless writing mean you can have labels for emotions

159
00:17:10,82 --> 00:17:13,99
but there's so much more to love war joy

160
00:17:13,99 --> 00:17:20,34
or sorrow that there is to just the label of it you know in the same way as

161
00:17:20,34 --> 00:17:28,87
when you see a beautiful piece of art you hear a gorgeous piece of music. All these feelings and thoughts.

162
00:17:30,53 --> 00:17:36,11
You know swell up inside you. But the words are only secondary right.

163
00:17:36,43 --> 00:17:45,37
It's there's a subjective experience going on inside the mind of the viewer are missing their own birth

164
00:17:46,00 --> 00:17:51,83
and it's a it's a thought you think this is a thought if you see a beautiful brain you will be a full damsel voice.

165
00:17:52,3 --> 00:17:59,07
So I think thoughts are heavily charged emotional thoughts are conscious thoughts.

166
00:18:00,42 --> 00:18:03,72
I think they can be conscious and I think they can be unconscious for it.

167
00:18:03,75 --> 00:18:08,87
You can have that unconscious feeling of just isn't this wonderful

168
00:18:09,93 --> 00:18:14,05
and then you can actually have a real conscious thing and so.

169
00:18:15,18 --> 00:18:15,43
You know

170
00:18:15,43 --> 00:18:22,81
when you were talking earlier about the timing of the storytelling if if some sort of dramatic music comes at the wrong.

171
00:18:24,01 --> 00:18:26,09
Time in the experience.

172
00:18:26,7 --> 00:18:34,42
You're certainly very conscious of it by all of a sudden skeptical thoughts come into your head where you think that's

173
00:18:34,42 --> 00:18:43,56
not right or I don't believe that or you see a bit of a film sequence it's out of sync and I stuffed up there.

174
00:18:44,55 --> 00:18:49,33
And all of a sudden those things that perhaps were that were before him gets a prompt

175
00:18:49,33 --> 00:18:52,52
or she would just sort of enjoying it but not really questioning

176
00:18:52,52 --> 00:18:58,58
or your sauce all of a sudden it's it's like it switched and suddenly think power on a minute.

177
00:19:00,68 --> 00:19:08,25
You know you're listening to no political politician speaking and all of a sudden you think. You shift all.

178
00:19:08,31 --> 00:19:10,16
I don't believe you for one minute.

179
00:19:11,02 --> 00:19:13,3
So you can be going back

180
00:19:13,3 --> 00:19:22,59
and listen to three until she turns them said they are my find myself synced believing every word he says because he

181
00:19:22,59 --> 00:19:29,28
has that kind of a voice where if he said. Nikki darling please jump off a cliff right now and commit suicide.

182
00:19:29,69 --> 00:19:35,22
I be halfway there before I was even realizing it because he's got such a persuasive voice.

183
00:19:35,44 --> 00:19:40,36
So you have a concert flip flopping you think between the cultures experience

184
00:19:40,36 --> 00:19:48,81
and the unconscious one we prosecutor me as when Clive and I dance in town here. If you were to say to me afterwards.

185
00:19:49,49 --> 00:20:00,89
What steps. The key dancer show me that move again I wouldn't remember. Because when we're dancing where. In the flow.

186
00:20:01,32 --> 00:20:07,81
Which is connected together wheeling is one of the music that I'm not thinking oh he wants me to do it.

187
00:20:08,47 --> 00:20:13,66
Backward option now or again show up on my brain doesn't work that way

188
00:20:13,66 --> 00:20:20,59
and just say I'm just subconsciously just connecting with Clive.

189
00:20:20,7 --> 00:20:28,1
I'm just moving together as well and synchrony to the music I'm not thinking about the moves and you often.

190
00:20:29,82 --> 00:20:34,78
And obviously that's particularly the case in something like tango where it's such a connecting to

191
00:20:34,78 --> 00:20:36,23
and improvised dance

192
00:20:36,62 --> 00:20:46,47
but even in Korea graphic sequences often you know they were her song director saying to one of the Don't don't have

193
00:20:46,47 --> 00:20:47,27
the same can't.

194
00:20:48,04 --> 00:20:56,56
Because if you put too much conscious thought conscious cognition into the process he will in the fluidity of the

195
00:20:56,56 --> 00:21:02,64
naturalists of the music itself as it was always an interesting juxtaposition between the conscious

196
00:21:02,64 --> 00:21:15,08
and unconscious thoughts. You know that's very very interesting and maybe we. You can talk about it later. Because.

197
00:21:16,49 --> 00:21:24,28
I would like to know because I just need to know how do you do your research about thinking.

198
00:21:25,62 --> 00:21:31,54
Because our viewer doesn't know anything so. So now that the in the in this part.

199
00:21:33,96 --> 00:21:38,7
I would like to feel the surprise that you research trials. You understand.

200
00:21:43,32 --> 00:21:47,94
So you mean you'd like me to talk about an experiment that was surprising.

201
00:21:48,07 --> 00:21:55,86
I don't know that know about but for our viewers. You know you you are you researched our mind about thinking.

202
00:21:57,34 --> 00:22:01,26
But there of you don't know if you knew who. Crocus.

203
00:22:02,87 --> 00:22:09,39
So when I ask you how do you do your research you want me to start when I work with crows. For example.

204
00:22:13,29 --> 00:22:23,28
So I suppose one way to define thoughts. Would be that I'm interested in studying the mental lives.

205
00:22:24,29 --> 00:22:33,35
And that it's see it's mental movements I suppose it's what's going on in the now and that I'm interested in

206
00:22:34,49 --> 00:22:41,69
and I were mainly when you as humans.

207
00:22:42,14 --> 00:22:50,03
And with crows and you might think well why crows or sexually monkeys I could understand that wire crab

208
00:22:50,65 --> 00:22:58,63
or crows are extremely intelligent they have huge bones of the body size they're as big as. Chimpanzees.

209
00:23:00,19 --> 00:23:03,51
In fact my husband scorn them for the Apes.

210
00:23:03,54 --> 00:23:10,47
When it comes to their national abilities because they're so cognitively impressive.

211
00:23:14,2 --> 00:23:23,98
And they're very they're very observant and very good problem solvers. So we.

212
00:23:24,67 --> 00:23:31,44
The way in which we do the experiments or to give them a series of problem solving puzzles. If you like.

213
00:23:32,68 --> 00:23:42,19
With a view to trying to systematically very second parameter is in order to try to get a handle on how they're

214
00:23:42,22 --> 00:23:46,67
thinking how they're solving. Apparently definitely.

215
00:23:47,19 --> 00:23:52,04
How do you know how do you know that cross theory because well because we can show that.

216
00:23:52,07 --> 00:23:59,71
And so good at solving these problems and they can think about the past and the future.

217
00:24:00,23 --> 00:24:08,87
For example we've been able to show in one experiment that they are kind of memories. They have fantastic memories.

218
00:24:09,84 --> 00:24:20,18
So you can crack it which is an American Corvette that lives in the cemetery in a higher power the mountains hides on

219
00:24:20,18 --> 00:24:31,42
average about thirty thousand seats a year and can remember the location of these thirty thousand caches

220
00:24:31,69 --> 00:24:37,66
and people have tested their memories over periods of nine months and found no evidence of forgetting.

221
00:24:38,18 --> 00:24:41,28
So they have really remarkable. I mean most of where they've hidden.

222
00:24:41,53 --> 00:24:53,07
It's not really remember where we were at but this is a fantastic memories and.

223
00:24:53,59 --> 00:25:00,69
Caching or the ability to hide food is a very interesting behavior for looking at aspects of cognition.

224
00:25:01,43 --> 00:25:06,3
Because you can ask how good are the memories and you can show that if you remove the seeds

225
00:25:06,3 --> 00:25:11,11
and we can possibly be using smell. They still go back to those particular places.

226
00:25:11,6 --> 00:25:17,61
We've been able to show that they don't just remember where the food is hidden they can remember which kinds of food

227
00:25:17,64 --> 00:25:22,87
were hidden where and how long ago so they can remember what happened where and when.

228
00:25:24,58 --> 00:25:30,48
We've been able to show that they can even remember which particular individuals were watching

229
00:25:30,51 --> 00:25:31,75
when they hit their food

230
00:25:31,87 --> 00:25:38,98
and the now come back later to move those foods to new hiding places which the potential themes by definition don't

231
00:25:38,98 --> 00:25:46,11
know about the new hiding places we've shown that when it comes to social awareness.

232
00:25:46,25 --> 00:25:53,92
They go to great lengths to protect their hidden food from being stolen by others. So for example.

233
00:25:55,64 --> 00:26:00,62
We've been able to show that if other birds. Watching.

234
00:26:01,12 --> 00:26:04,79
Not only do they move them to new places when the on the beds of come back

235
00:26:05,19 --> 00:26:13,42
but they will also have specifically hired the food in shady spots rather than well lit places which are much harder

236
00:26:13,42 --> 00:26:18,6
for the onlooker to see and in fact in a way we discovered there was we had a B.B.C.

237
00:26:18,6 --> 00:26:23,73
One film crew can't they were filming for a series called Child of Our Time

238
00:26:24,87 --> 00:26:34,19
and the cameraman got very frustrated because Sweetie Pie who was a very tame beautiful script I would wait

239
00:26:34,19 --> 00:26:39,34
and an only had food every time a cameraman had to take a toilet break.

240
00:26:41,02 --> 00:26:48,11
And eventually I had to say to the cameraman look away at an hour tell you when to start recording

241
00:26:48,79 --> 00:26:56,49
and that was the only way we could film her and then we noticed that she was only hiding in the the places in the.

242
00:26:57,38 --> 00:26:58,85
Reader that were well lit

243
00:26:59,1 --> 00:27:05,91
and that gave us the idea to actually test where she specifically choosing shady places one observers were present

244
00:27:05,91 --> 00:27:11,1
and we found that sure enough if another bad point or human was looking.

245
00:27:11,49 --> 00:27:17,14
She would selectively cash in the shade of spots. And so would all the other birds we tested.

246
00:27:17,47 --> 00:27:22,48
Where as if she was cashing private she was happy to cash in sunny and shady spots.

247
00:27:22,8 --> 00:27:31,42
We've even shown that these kind of catch protection tactics that the parents do say moving with cash is hiding in

248
00:27:31,46 --> 00:27:34,14
and shady spots and so on and so forth

249
00:27:34,75 --> 00:27:41,00
and they're only done by experienced parents naive parents who've had no experience of stealing his don't do it.

250
00:27:41,00 --> 00:27:49,11
So it's not just a hard wired. Instinctive ability more evidence that it's theory of mind that you.

251
00:27:49,44 --> 00:27:53,72
Once you've had the experience of stealing yourself you can put yourselves in wooden shoes

252
00:27:53,72 --> 00:27:59,72
and go Oh well if I was that bed. I would be watching where there is cash is where I'd come back and still.

253
00:28:00,38 --> 00:28:06,42
So I better leave them to new places but they only engage in statics when they themselves have been themes.

254
00:28:07,02 --> 00:28:10,49
It's really quite impressive but that sounds very interesting

255
00:28:10,49 --> 00:28:17,93
and you convince me of some of those travelling very smart or capable of thinking.

256
00:28:18,42 --> 00:28:29,57
A problem solving problems but what are you interesting interesting in how. Crowds. Because of family. Things or.

257
00:28:30,58 --> 00:28:34,23
Does the deal in the end I want to find out how we think.

258
00:28:35,00 --> 00:28:42,77
Both both so I would argue in the same way as if you want to know how a computer works.

259
00:28:43,28 --> 00:28:48,23
You wouldn't want to only use an Apple not you'd want to also look at how a P.C.

260
00:28:48,23 --> 00:28:50,64
Works and see the similarities

261
00:28:50,64 --> 00:28:58,63
and differences in your types of computer in order to have a better understanding of how computers work in the same way

262
00:28:59,43 --> 00:29:05,17
I'm going to have a better understanding I think about how our brains where.

263
00:29:05,55 --> 00:29:06,9
If I look at similarities

264
00:29:06,9 --> 00:29:17,11
and differences between crows in people because they crows are very distantly related to us we share a common ancestor

265
00:29:17,11 --> 00:29:21,00
with them over three hundred million years ago. Well.

266
00:29:21,42 --> 00:29:26,84
We as humans we as mammals it depends how you want to look at it but

267
00:29:27,17 --> 00:29:30,81
but Danson mammals had a common ancestor over three hundred million years ago.

268
00:29:30,86 --> 00:29:35,85
So there's been a long time in our evolutionary history in which we've been diverging moving

269
00:29:35,85 --> 00:29:44,97
and down different paths and the. Our brains and those of other mammals are layered so our cortex has six layers to it.

270
00:29:45,1 --> 00:29:53,06
Whereas the bird brain is doesn't have layers it's nucleated So the analogy might be that a bird brain

271
00:29:53,06 --> 00:29:59,69
and a mammalian brain are a human brain. They are both full of these nerve cells which are so important.

272
00:30:00,21 --> 00:30:06,1
Full thinking processes and my analogy would be if I imagine cakes. The.

273
00:30:06,74 --> 00:30:13,06
Brain is like a fruit cake and the mammalian brain is like a six layered Austrian chocolate cake the subtlety.

274
00:30:13,42 --> 00:30:20,19
So they're both made of cake mix but the structure or the layout the the architecture is actually quite different.

275
00:30:20,48 --> 00:30:28,61
So that one raises interesting questions about whether those different new architectures might have might impose

276
00:30:28,61 --> 00:30:40,8
different constraints on our thinking patterns. Well. What did you learn from across. So far. Well. Many things.

277
00:30:41,00 --> 00:30:47,45
So firstly we've learned that they have really sophisticated cognitive abilities so there were a number of things that

278
00:30:48,1 --> 00:30:55,45
were thought to be unique to human beings so at one time it was said that to manufacture is uniquely human

279
00:30:55,45 --> 00:30:59,89
and the knife discovered. Well known seems to all's we've now found that.

280
00:31:00,6 --> 00:31:07,19
All the crows that we've tested all the different species will happily use tools

281
00:31:07,19 --> 00:31:12,75
and even make them even though they don't necessarily use tools in the wilds of New Caledonian crows.

282
00:31:13,56 --> 00:31:20,05
Rely heavily on tools to find food in the wild but works and Jerry is down.

283
00:31:20,3 --> 00:31:21,7
They will use

284
00:31:21,7 --> 00:31:30,81
and make tools in the lab if they're given a task that requires one thousand you can stimulate the thinking process.

285
00:31:31,33 --> 00:31:37,74
Yes So you know normally work has a very long bail and the kinds of foods they eat.

286
00:31:39,28 --> 00:31:46,94
Are usually things like earthworms in the soil so for that you don't need a tool you just need to insert your big deep

287
00:31:46,94 --> 00:31:50,72
into the soil and they have patches around their houses which are commonly

288
00:31:50,72 --> 00:31:56,29
and adaptation for being able to dig the earthworms and other grams that are in the soil

289
00:31:56,29 --> 00:31:59,99
but for that event we don't need to chill. But if you get.

290
00:32:00,25 --> 00:32:08,22
There a task in the lab where they will need to chill in order to reach the food they will happily use tools

291
00:32:08,22 --> 00:32:10,62
and make tools. Don't. Can we see that.

292
00:32:10,75 --> 00:32:20,14
You do have any proof or evidence or I can show you some video footage of books spontaneously taking a piece of wire

293
00:32:20,14 --> 00:32:23,68
and bending it into a hawk to retrieve a bucket.

294
00:32:23,88 --> 00:32:29,81
That's out a bit which I can show you works in Jayne's using stones

295
00:32:29,81 --> 00:32:32,56
and other objects to raise the water level to get worms.

296
00:32:32,81 --> 00:32:39,74
So the so we don't travel the world in travel so we've got we've got what video footage

297
00:32:39,74 --> 00:32:45,32
and powerful we can show you a lot to morrow and hundreds of police Great copies of anything so light.

298
00:32:45,35 --> 00:32:57,34
How do we as humans are a species benefit from our from what you learn from growth. How do we benefit. Well.

299
00:32:57,81 --> 00:33:01,48
I think people are fascinated by animals.

300
00:33:01,88 --> 00:33:12,1
And you know a lot of people would love to go far away and see chimpanzees in the wild making tools

301
00:33:12,1 --> 00:33:15,26
and interacting with your lovely our brother.

302
00:33:16,24 --> 00:33:22,62
Footage the whole idea that that these other day pass are actually in the back garden.

303
00:33:23,28 --> 00:33:28,13
It's pretty pretty stunning in thinking that you can actually watch them.

304
00:33:28,42 --> 00:33:30,7
Solving problems and interaction

305
00:33:30,7 --> 00:33:36,61
and it's not just sure you know that was one thing that was levied is uniquely human we now know it's not.

306
00:33:37,02 --> 00:33:46,07
And why is that interesting. Well it's one of a number of things that we thought was perhaps responsible for.

307
00:33:46,59 --> 00:33:56,96
How we've come to get our sophisticated cognitive abilities but if these birds have it too. Then we're not unique.

308
00:33:57,07 --> 00:33:59,81
So EVA that means that I'm not.

309
00:34:00,01 --> 00:34:05,33
More animals out there have it than we thought or it means that only a select few have it

310
00:34:05,83 --> 00:34:13,11
and in which case probably these abilities have evolved in very different calibers with very different brains

311
00:34:13,32 --> 00:34:16,61
but probably for similar reason that.

312
00:34:16,85 --> 00:34:24,34
That raises the question What is that similar reason is it because of needing to be innovative problem solvers.

313
00:34:24,6 --> 00:34:28,9
And therefore to be able to. Make sure if we need them.

314
00:34:30,02 --> 00:34:39,39
Or is it because of our complex social lives the fact that we've form long term relationships with others.

315
00:34:40,61 --> 00:34:48,04
That we're very good at being able to detect. Who's honest and who's cheating.

316
00:34:48,33 --> 00:34:57,76
We're able to form alliances and political maneuvers to strengthen our chance of overcoming our enemies.

317
00:34:58,02 --> 00:35:06,43
Politics is a good example of that we know that the chimpanzees form complex relationships alliances

318
00:35:06,43 --> 00:35:08,66
and can do these kind of primate politics.

319
00:35:09,13 --> 00:35:17,88
More recently we discovered that these call these numbers of the crow family and the Ravens and gays can do.

320
00:35:18,37 --> 00:35:21,09
Form these complex social relationships.

321
00:35:23,34 --> 00:35:31,13
So I think it raises I like him can you give examples to the social relations are you going to follow along for example

322
00:35:32,52 --> 00:35:34,72
while I perfectly life that's for sure.

323
00:35:35,02 --> 00:35:41,06
And I've been very worried when I I remember when two of our chapter

324
00:35:41,06 --> 00:35:49,72
or so you're like this because the chapters were named after its solitaire so we had Nico Tintagel and Conrad Duran's.

325
00:35:50,53 --> 00:35:59,99
And when Konrad Lorenz Starlight the capital Conrad Lawrence as opposed to the human Konrad Lorenz Nico was our.

326
00:36:00,01 --> 00:36:05,91
Absolutely devastated and just stopped eating and could hardly hardly move for about a week

327
00:36:05,91 --> 00:36:12,09
and I was really worried we were going to lose him. Eventually he was all right.

328
00:36:13,03 --> 00:36:23,92
But it looked to me like emotional devastation of course it's very difficult to know exactly how you would say whether

329
00:36:23,92 --> 00:36:26,9
the bird was in love but certainly in terms of their behavior.

330
00:36:27,33 --> 00:36:34,71
It was it was consistent with being in love and then being bereft. They they usually pair for life.

331
00:36:35,23 --> 00:36:43,49
So for me it's very stable long term monogamous relationships because it's also a process that they have.

332
00:36:45,28 --> 00:36:53,07
Well certainly and things that track it was it Farrah Porton refuted defendant and nest travertine and have offspring.

333
00:36:53,32 --> 00:36:54,23
It helps to.

334
00:36:56,17 --> 00:37:02,26
You know I'm trapped all does is right down the bottom of the pecking order so you don't want to just find a mate

335
00:37:02,61 --> 00:37:05,75
produce young and then go off and then find another one money and

336
00:37:05,94 --> 00:37:09,12
when you need that mean really need to stay as a couple.

337
00:37:10,27 --> 00:37:16,12
We also know in the chains for example that during the breeding season the male will feed the female

338
00:37:16,6 --> 00:37:19,96
and this courtship It is very common in a number of birds.

339
00:37:21,03 --> 00:37:26,43
It's just that in the jail is they do it very delicately which means that we can actually see

340
00:37:26,43 --> 00:37:31,78
and I can show you footage of this. What's the male feeds the female.

341
00:37:32,54 --> 00:37:39,81
So we can we can actually see the items physically being transferred from his beak to her being so we can count what

342
00:37:39,81 --> 00:37:43,17
kinds of food and how many so we can quantify the food sharing

343
00:37:43,6 --> 00:37:50,75
and what we've been able to show in a series of experiments is that the male J.I.

344
00:37:50,78 --> 00:37:59,99
Is able to feed the female what she wants even if that's different to what he wants. So for example.

345
00:38:00,01 --> 00:38:07,34
If I've just seen to help box of chocolates and it's and then you've maybe left a couple at the end.

346
00:38:07,34 --> 00:38:11,76
So I'm pretty sure your fault of chocolate. Even though I like chocolate.

347
00:38:12,1 --> 00:38:18,29
I could infer that you done with the chocolates now you're probably going to want something different to eat.

348
00:38:18,34 --> 00:38:26,59
Well the Jays can can also do that they can ignore their own desire of what they want in order to cater for what their.

349
00:38:26,91 --> 00:38:33,74
Female ones. Do you can use to say that thinking is an evolutionary process.

350
00:38:34,14 --> 00:38:41,28
So if it if it develops in the mind in the crow's mind across brain.

351
00:38:41,96 --> 00:38:55,21
Can you say that our own thinking is developing as well. Is that there can you develop thinking.

352
00:38:56,07 --> 00:39:00,57
Yes I mean you know young children are not record at certain aspects of thinking.

353
00:39:00,8 --> 00:39:08,84
So for example children before the age of four don't understand what a lie is because they can't understand that your

354
00:39:08,84 --> 00:39:11,23
point if you can be different from our point of view.

355
00:39:11,38 --> 00:39:18,73
So there's a famous task called the Sally Ann task which will demonstrate for you tomorrow that illustrates this way

356
00:39:18,73 --> 00:39:26,52
you ask a little child. You say there is one dollar that has seen an item being hidden in one box and then the.

357
00:39:26,81 --> 00:39:28,08
Dolly goes out the room.

358
00:39:28,39 --> 00:39:38,04
And then the food is the move from that box to a new box a little child learn to understand that Sally who left the

359
00:39:38,04 --> 00:39:45,91
room doesn't know that the child has moved here because of Sally saw as it go in the first box the little child will

360
00:39:45,91 --> 00:39:51,99
assume that Sally knows just what she knows which is that the toy is now in this box not in that box

361
00:39:51,99 --> 00:39:59,44
and similarly young children. Don't have a concept of yesterday and tomorrow or.

362
00:40:00,08 --> 00:40:03,1
Either of those things the ability to think about other minds

363
00:40:03,39 --> 00:40:09,85
and to think about other times those two things don't develop until children reach about the age of forty

364
00:40:09,96 --> 00:40:20,2
but I mean of course. You know. People's lives thinking develops. But I mean for our species.

365
00:40:20,23 --> 00:40:28,44
I don't think the development is in one of the thousand year or a million years. Do we have.

366
00:40:29,83 --> 00:40:37,7
Development of a crime if the well that's an interesting question isn't it. The extent to which I think changes.

367
00:40:38,69 --> 00:40:45,51
At one level you could sort of say well look our brains haven't really changed much in an instant.

368
00:40:47,14 --> 00:40:49,12
Since the beginning in humans.

369
00:40:49,14 --> 00:40:49,63
If you like

370
00:40:49,63 --> 00:40:57,97
and so that's probably a sense in which we're not any more intelligent now it's only the way that we're that what I'm

371
00:40:57,97 --> 00:41:00,08
going to give you to alternative arguments.

372
00:41:00,22 --> 00:41:08,35
OK said that one case would be our brains haven't changed so probably at least since our ability to read

373
00:41:08,35 --> 00:41:15,42
and write our thinking skills haven't improved we're probably no more or less intelligent than we were then.

374
00:41:15,65 --> 00:41:26,23
The other line of argument for me to say well I don't know not whether or intelligence per se has changed

375
00:41:26,23 --> 00:41:36,9
but our thinking patterns may well have done that whole notion that we live in a digital age water's locked on to our

376
00:41:36,9 --> 00:41:42,26
brains so most people I think tend to remember telephone numbers any more.

377
00:41:42,27 --> 00:41:47,9
You just pick an interval phone and you say actually this and press the button. And.

378
00:41:48,87 --> 00:41:59,27
We have computers and i Phones and i Pads that and the hours to record information in ways which I think.

379
00:42:00,14 --> 00:42:08,11
It's fundamentally changing how we think I'll give you just one example in an area that that I happen to know about

380
00:42:08,11 --> 00:42:15,32
which courses dance and in both contemporary dance sound in. Ballet.

381
00:42:16,55 --> 00:42:24,09
When you buy me develop a new choreograph it work in the old

382
00:42:24,09 --> 00:42:31,94
and everything used to be written down through particular notation for example a lot of notation.

383
00:42:33,07 --> 00:42:40,02
And of course there was a bit of ambiguity. When you come to reinterpret the story.

384
00:42:40,04 --> 00:42:47,38
So if you go back in Latine original permitted in for when you want to make a new production it's ramen dead

385
00:42:47,38 --> 00:42:56,37
and he hasn't twelve the new you want to stick as closely to what you. You think was meant by their original tabular G.

386
00:42:56,37 --> 00:43:01,67
It's all a series of of notations which describe the basic moves

387
00:43:01,67 --> 00:43:09,05
but obviously that's going to be some ambiguity in what those things mean in the same way as if you're if film many

388
00:43:09,05 --> 00:43:09,33
care

389
00:43:09,33 --> 00:43:18,76
and you want to develop a new version of a particular series based on the book of course there's the information in the

390
00:43:18,76 --> 00:43:25,4
book but then said layers on top of that that need interpreting but of course these days in dance.

391
00:43:25,7 --> 00:43:28,68
What most choreograph is do is to record it.

392
00:43:28,9 --> 00:43:42,74
So now you don't have that same level of interpretation you just watched the video footage of the piece so that's a way

393
00:43:42,74 --> 00:43:45,16
in which our thinking probably has changed.

394
00:43:45,57 --> 00:43:51,42
I think there are a lot of people is that my area that there are a lot of people obviously something things like how

395
00:43:51,42 --> 00:44:01,21
Twitter and Facebook and those forms of social media are affecting the way in which. Our social into. Actions where.

396
00:44:02,83 --> 00:44:03,68
So.

397
00:44:05,03 --> 00:44:09,46
But but don't you say I don't know if our thinking develops

398
00:44:09,49 --> 00:44:18,15
and maybe in the future we will develop another way of thinking well that's a really exciting question I think was well

399
00:44:18,37 --> 00:44:26,09
the question of whether by understanding more about how we think now we could find new ways of thinking.

400
00:44:26,4 --> 00:44:33,97
So I think that's the golden look at that it's very interesting to think with words and with outward

401
00:44:33,97 --> 00:44:42,68
and see what I do with Clive working on the Capital One of our think goals are big picture blue skies question is

402
00:44:43,02 --> 00:44:46,66
whether under what extend it's possible to think beyond words.

403
00:44:47,33 --> 00:44:52,67
And that's why we're so interested in looking at the constraints on our cognition.

404
00:44:53,43 --> 00:44:59,88
And the patterns of thinking to see if that would generate new ways of thinking. Yes it's what.

405
00:45:01,33 --> 00:45:06,71
You know it's one of the main goals of art is to examine ideas and.

406
00:45:08,00 --> 00:45:15,48
So I think one of the things we're interested in is looking at constraints on our memories

407
00:45:15,48 --> 00:45:20,67
and our perceptions as being the first baby steps in that direction because that's a basic eyes question.

408
00:45:21,04 --> 00:45:28,59
We're not going to solve that question that we might get it a step closer to it. So it's trying to understand you know.

409
00:45:30,69 --> 00:45:39,59
Why is it we missed so much of what happened and we missed so much of what we see in there

410
00:45:39,81 --> 00:45:42,67
and I think that's really interesting question and we miss a lot.

411
00:45:43,1 --> 00:45:50,57
Yeah but many of them will work and if we didn't all magicians would be out of business. Wouldn't I.

412
00:45:50,85 --> 00:45:59,74
Because a magic effect capitalizes on the fact that there are a number of things that go well in a sequence that.

413
00:46:00,57 --> 00:46:11,74
We miss if we saw every move that the magician and they in executing the fact. It wouldn't work as a magic trick me go.

414
00:46:12,85 --> 00:46:16,39
Thanks a lot. You know why you're wasting my time.

415
00:46:16,71 --> 00:46:24,52
It's the fact that we we know very well that the heart literally of vanished in thin air and yet our eyes

416
00:46:24,52 --> 00:46:32,38
and our visual cortex our mind is telling us that that's precisely what time is always a challenge between facts

417
00:46:32,38 --> 00:46:36,44
or magic and and are we think well that's just one example.

418
00:46:36,99 --> 00:46:43,43
Another example would be with memory and perhaps I don't want to say too that gently catch Clive

419
00:46:43,43 --> 00:46:46,2
and I interrupting because it's probably more powerful than two of us

420
00:46:46,2 --> 00:46:51,29
but there's a phrase we really like to use which is you don't remember what happened.

421
00:46:52,38 --> 00:46:55,34
What you remember becomes what happened.

422
00:46:55,74 --> 00:47:00,88
So the whole idea that actually and we all know this when you say that

423
00:47:00,88 --> 00:47:08,01
and yet you don't remember what happened what you remember becomes what happened.

424
00:47:09,21 --> 00:47:15,62
So I think many people have had the sex parents live not seen a friend for years.

425
00:47:15,91 --> 00:47:22,42
And you revenues about an event that you guys went to it was in their in their mental events and you.

426
00:47:22,59 --> 00:47:27,57
You know it's a treasured memory for both of you and you start comparing notes about the event

427
00:47:27,57 --> 00:47:37,6
and you realize that your memory is involved don't match totally you know that's interesting you know you have a memory

428
00:47:37,6 --> 00:47:45,13
that. She was wearing a beautiful pair of rug shoes aren't she's never no they were black.

429
00:47:45,3 --> 00:47:53,15
And she has a memory of it that you had a glass of champagne music. No no I was drinking.

430
00:47:53,4 --> 00:47:59,35
I was driving I was just drinking coconut water and you like but how can this be. How can I remember it's.

431
00:48:00,54 --> 00:48:06,41
And these are good friends you know we thought we thought thought similarly at others I'm not sharing this with an

432
00:48:06,44 --> 00:48:07,71
alien from another planet

433
00:48:07,71 --> 00:48:13,97
and one of you know it was my mistress the Bayshore head was just inaccurate you suddenly realize that the whole

434
00:48:13,97 --> 00:48:21,43
mismatches have false memories where it. Is a is a can you compare thoughts.

435
00:48:21,95 --> 00:48:37,33
With something like something unique like your eyes or you or your face or. Is it. If you need a way you think.

436
00:48:38,17 --> 00:48:40,79
Well I think memory is a unique. Yes.

437
00:48:41,4 --> 00:48:47,25
And I think it's very interesting that we often think of memory as being an accurate repository of the past

438
00:48:47,67 --> 00:48:55,11
but it isn't our memories are extremely subjective and they're seeing through our own eyes so.

439
00:48:56,78 --> 00:48:59,11
In our work with the caption thought.

440
00:48:59,59 --> 00:49:05,7
Crime and I talk about memory as being the door to identity because our memory shape who we are.

441
00:49:06,56 --> 00:49:15,93
And our identities our individuality shapes the way in which we choose to record. And remember.

442
00:49:16,62 --> 00:49:27,74
Those instances that become our memories and that's why we don't remember what actually happened.

443
00:49:28,18 --> 00:49:35,27
We have a subjective take on it. We remember those dates that interest and relevance to us.

444
00:49:35,97 --> 00:49:43,7
And quite often we can discover that there are aspects of our memory that didn't even happen at all

445
00:49:43,73 --> 00:49:49,16
or happened in quite a different way and we can do that by sharing our memories of Alice

446
00:49:49,55 --> 00:49:56,07
and discovering that there are bits of my memory and your memory of the same event but don't match

447
00:49:56,69 --> 00:49:59,99
and there's a lot of research that's been done on the notion of forms.

448
00:50:00,09 --> 00:50:09,23
Memory by Elizabeth Loftus where she's found that. The way in which you. Phrase a question can.

449
00:50:09,84 --> 00:50:16,35
Bias people to remember things in quite a different way from the way it actually happened.

450
00:50:16,38 --> 00:50:22,2
So you might show somebody certain footage of an event that sets a car going.

451
00:50:23,39 --> 00:50:26,05
At twenty miles an hour or forty miles an hour.

452
00:50:27,66 --> 00:50:34,21
But actually the way in which you phrased the question afterwards that the car smashed into the Lhari

453
00:50:34,93 --> 00:50:43,79
or the car bumped into the lorry will have a much more dramatic impact on the memory that person has of the event

454
00:50:44,18 --> 00:50:48,14
but the actual speed that the car was going. False memory.

455
00:50:48,86 --> 00:50:56,45
You know as you know as women are up more or less it's doesn't mean that the way we remember them.

456
00:50:58,33 --> 00:51:08,24
You said that determines our identity. That's right. So it's very personal. When you think. Yeah yeah.

457
00:51:08,51 --> 00:51:20,02
Memories are subjective experiences. So there are no two memories alive from different persons. Well I think.

458
00:51:20,37 --> 00:51:25,53
They're all different you know even if it is a loved one with whom you are very close and

459
00:51:25,8 --> 00:51:33,58
and you know feel that you sink in the same way your memories are still going to be slightly different because you know

460
00:51:33,88 --> 00:51:36,26
they're seen through a different set of eyes

461
00:51:36,89 --> 00:51:44,99
and they're being filtered through a different mind because everybody's experiences are different from one another so I

462
00:51:44,99 --> 00:51:53,00
think even two identical twins would still have slightly different memories. Oh oh well that's that's interesting.

463
00:51:53,2 --> 00:52:02,95
I never I never looked at it like that. I thought well if you have been of the same. Occasion and you must think.

464
00:52:03,85 --> 00:52:06,31
But we put our own subjective stamp on it

465
00:52:06,76 --> 00:52:16,58
and that's I think where integrating science funding arts to study these kinds of questions becomes so important

466
00:52:17,29 --> 00:52:23,23
and so insightful because it's easy as a scientist just to think very objectively and go.

467
00:52:25,3 --> 00:52:31,25
These these are the things that are being remembered that that has a list of things that happened in this event

468
00:52:31,78 --> 00:52:36,7
happened in this particular room at this time on a particular day.

469
00:52:37,00 --> 00:52:44,19
She was wearing this he was wearing that but that's not how our memories were not just a series of labels.

470
00:52:44,78 --> 00:52:52,2
She was effect a series of facts it's about me the emotional experience

471
00:52:53,00 --> 00:52:59,55
and that's the difference perhaps between that's one aspect of why I would call it a thought

472
00:53:01,59 --> 00:53:08,45
and a series of facts so we labels it extremely crude be extremely objective

473
00:53:08,51 --> 00:53:11,73
but your thoughts are personal of my subjective

474
00:53:12,05 --> 00:53:17,95
and sometimes they can change depending on how you're feeling on a particular day. So you may revisit a memory.

475
00:53:19,02 --> 00:53:21,63
In consequence of which you actually change it.

476
00:53:21,83 --> 00:53:27,05
You don't just revisit it and go down the list of things that happened

477
00:53:27,05 --> 00:53:32,17
but all of a sudden because of something else you've discovered in the interim

478
00:53:32,17 --> 00:53:43,19
or because of a different mood you're in your well being. You reshape it. So when you say that the sexual.

479
00:53:43,83 --> 00:53:59,57
Memory or the. Affection remember our objective but because who you are and. Because. The time. That the It Gets.

480
00:54:01,25 --> 00:54:08,27
Filtered through your mind. It's subjective and. That's that's how the form is created.

481
00:54:09,38 --> 00:54:14,28
Well sort of I think it's a bit more complex than that. I mean. How Yeah.

482
00:54:15,00 --> 00:54:21,95
Because I sing A Well I think there are of actual labels that we remember with precision.

483
00:54:22,47 --> 00:54:26,2
London for capital of England. No idea how I know that information.

484
00:54:26,23 --> 00:54:32,07
I don't have a memory of how and then the information but it's just something I know. And that's not going to change.

485
00:54:32,27 --> 00:54:39,08
I'm not going to revisit my knowledge that. The fact that London is a couple of England.

486
00:54:39,09 --> 00:54:41,2
That's not going to change that

487
00:54:41,2 --> 00:54:49,17
but much of our memories are not purely factually based they have all these other components to them.

488
00:54:49,32 --> 00:54:51,66
And the difference there.

489
00:54:51,8 --> 00:54:56,94
I think arises because we've each got a new unique pair of eyes

490
00:54:56,94 --> 00:55:02,25
and a unique mind that filtering all those things as as you said

491
00:55:02,25 --> 00:55:09,94
but I think it's also because we're selective in our attention. So we also don't see everything that's going on.

492
00:55:10,27 --> 00:55:17,88
And therefore another reason why we might have different memories of the event quite aside from with different eyes

493
00:55:17,88 --> 00:55:24,89
and different minds is that my viewpoint of what I see is different to your viewpoint.

494
00:55:24,95 --> 00:55:30,43
What you see so we can both be looking at the bird and I know that.

495
00:55:30,65 --> 00:55:36,14
When you're looking at the does that stuff behind me that you're going to see

496
00:55:36,14 --> 00:55:39,47
and similar you know that what I'm looking at the bird.

497
00:55:39,48 --> 00:55:40,93
I can see Clive

498
00:55:40,93 --> 00:55:46,54
and I can see the background wall over there which is not something that you can see at the moment because you're

499
00:55:46,54 --> 00:55:47,96
looking at the bird and you're looking at me.

500
00:55:48,16 --> 00:55:53,75
So that's a selective attention difference as well as a filtering difference.

501
00:55:54,05 --> 00:55:58,77
So that's what I meant to submit there I think the instance of that surely.

502
00:56:01,73 --> 00:56:17,41
Well when you when you try to research crowds. For children. How hard is it to try to understand alien brains.

503
00:56:18,49 --> 00:56:20,52
Yes well it's is it.

504
00:56:23,97 --> 00:56:29,88
But I suppose it depends on your point of view I spent so many years trying to think about what it's like to be a bird

505
00:56:29,94 --> 00:56:32,18
that to me it's not very alien at all.

506
00:56:33,6 --> 00:56:41,81
But at another level of course Italian because however hard I try to imagine what it's like to be a crow.

507
00:56:42,35 --> 00:56:44,92
I'm not a crow and I never will be sadly.

508
00:56:45,59 --> 00:56:52,26
And however much I think about how children might be thinking it's a long time. Sadly to the time I was a child.

509
00:56:53,34 --> 00:56:54,78
And even

510
00:56:54,78 --> 00:57:02,94
when I was a child I wasn't the same as the children I'm investigating because we have all these individual subjective

511
00:57:03,19 --> 00:57:13,05
differences we've been talking about. So all you can do scientifically I think is to present various kinds of problems.

512
00:57:13,89 --> 00:57:18,91
And ask how the subjects be them crows or children

513
00:57:18,94 --> 00:57:25,87
or adult humans are solving the task that's what you're trying to do you are trying to get what the constraints on the

514
00:57:25,87 --> 00:57:31,62
thinking are what the milestones are and how how much individual differences there are

515
00:57:31,99 --> 00:57:42,59
and what those milestones are both within children and within the closed. Well what exactly are you looking for.

516
00:57:45,13 --> 00:57:48,08
I don't know what you mean by that. Well.

517
00:57:49,76 --> 00:57:59,87
Somehow there isn't you feel the need to do to research this find out how thinking worse and.

518
00:58:00,01 --> 00:58:09,51
And somehow try to find that kind of secret because you don't know. And you want to find out. That's right. And so.

519
00:58:10,11 --> 00:58:16,63
I'm interested in knowing what the constraints are on our thinking processes.

520
00:58:18,58 --> 00:58:25,25
And thinking about but is there a reason why you you do this.

521
00:58:25,43 --> 00:58:35,3
Well I've always wanted to know what it's like to think like a bat that's for sure

522
00:58:35,3 --> 00:58:46,22
but I'm also interested in knowing whether there are new ways of thinking that we're not aware of

523
00:58:46,22 --> 00:58:56,48
but by understanding better what some of these constraints are on our thinking processes that make that might give us

524
00:58:56,48 --> 00:58:59,77
clues into what these new ways of thinking might be

525
00:58:59,77 --> 00:59:04,98
and that's where the work that I do with Clive on the capture thought that's

526
00:59:04,98 --> 00:59:09,48
when that is so critical because by bringing in these different perspectives

527
00:59:09,48 --> 00:59:13,45
and trying to understand more about what those fundamental features are.

528
00:59:15,29 --> 00:59:22,03
That might help us better understand how we could improve our thinking skills

529
00:59:22,03 --> 00:59:36,5
or thinking new way is that we not aware of at the moment. Are you able to think in different ways. Yes I think so.

530
00:59:36,54 --> 00:59:39,65
I mean I think so you can thing in words but

531
00:59:39,65 --> 00:59:50,15
but I think most of us can think without words as well as of us a century before you know when Clive

532
00:59:50,15 --> 00:59:58,82
and I don't seem to go together. I'm not but I try to understand because. If I think.

533
01:00:00,22 --> 01:00:04,5
Well I probably thinking words but but I never had a thought about it.

534
01:00:06,72 --> 01:00:15,33
So I try to be aware of the the different ways I can think. OK Well all of us can think you know.

535
01:00:16,03 --> 01:00:27,45
Well let me try it with an example and have something more simple. You like Mike. So imagine.

536
01:00:27,96 --> 01:00:34,55
I've just put you a glass of wine you take a sip of it. And it's really nice. It's the nicest wine.

537
01:00:34,75 --> 01:00:38,86
You can ever remember tasting you have this gorgeous experience.

538
01:00:40,11 --> 01:00:46,47
Words are really going to describe for you that experience of the taste of that exquisite why.

539
01:00:47,16 --> 01:00:55,54
You know we we use artificial words do you say don't we say this one's got lots of cherries in black currant But you

540
01:00:55,54 --> 01:01:01,45
know it's a glass of wine and it's made from grape juice there aren't any cherries or black currents really in there.

541
01:01:01,46 --> 01:01:10,57
These They're only labels that we're trying to attach to these things to share our experiences of this thing that it's

542
01:01:10,57 --> 01:01:12,91
really an experience it's not and

543
01:01:12,91 --> 01:01:20,54
and the words are only have a rough approximation of the way of sharing the experiences.

544
01:01:20,78 --> 01:01:24,41
So that's the kind of thing that both I mean.

545
01:01:26,91 --> 01:01:32,57
Somehow just putting words only in the same way as that sent with with the tongue or you know just saying.

546
01:01:32,67 --> 01:01:37,35
Clive let me until that point up show us something.

547
01:01:37,81 --> 01:01:47,71
It doesn't describe the exquisite experience of dancing tango it's just a label folk.

548
01:01:48,64 --> 01:01:50,73
Whether apartment forwards or backwards.

549
01:01:51,27 --> 01:02:02,04
It doesn't really capture it captures an tiniest little aspect of the words for sure. Words for sure.

550
01:02:05,68 --> 01:02:35,55
For thinking but thinking. I never looked like that. Is it possible not to think. Yes when you died.

551
01:02:38,04 --> 01:02:46,33
I think it's pretty impossible not to think when your life whether you are aware of the thoughts is another matter.

552
01:02:47,08 --> 01:02:55,93
So there are you know interesting cases of people who don't necessarily have conscious access to their thoughts.

553
01:02:59,44 --> 01:03:02,4
A classic case of that would be.

554
01:03:03,11 --> 01:03:08,72
You know nominees it needs to be a memory loss he doesn't have access to they've witnessed the events

555
01:03:08,72 --> 01:03:18,37
but somehow the events haven't been I don't have conscious access to what happened at all. All patients are blind side.

556
01:03:18,71 --> 01:03:26,1
I can see that they're not sure where but they can see so if you ask them.

557
01:03:26,4 --> 01:03:29,73
Did you see that I said No no I haven't seen you haven't seen anything.

558
01:03:29,84 --> 01:03:34,4
I'm blind but then if you say I just guess that highly accurate.

559
01:03:35,31 --> 01:03:40,89
So that I have seen it but my brain has it registered the information that they've actually seen it.

560
01:03:41,33 --> 01:03:59,95
Have you ever considered the thought that when you die. The only thing that virus is your are your thoughts. No a.

561
01:04:00,65 --> 01:04:05,1
Just come up with that because you say well you stop thinking when you're dead but maybe then

562
01:04:05,77 --> 01:04:11,26
when your body dies you understand what I mean yeah but where would those thoughts go.

563
01:04:15,43 --> 01:04:20,76
I don't know the trying to think out loud.

564
01:04:21,17 --> 01:04:28,6
Just maybe that would be interesting because because because it's it's hard not to think.

565
01:04:29,93 --> 01:04:34,95
This or that because they're carrying on the culture and in society.

566
01:04:36,22 --> 01:04:39,63
You know it's as if it might be a hope for example doesn't it.

567
01:04:39,66 --> 01:04:45,15
It's a bit hard to tell if you answer the questions and we're going to film you. Yes that no no I talk.

568
01:04:45,32 --> 01:04:51,19
I'm just having some think you're great. Yeah OK. Also you know why didn't they didn't listen to it.

569
01:04:51,21 --> 01:04:58,78
Well maybe you can I was probably prompting you to ask your US Next question. OK People are certain that.

570
01:04:59,67 --> 01:05:05,92
The thoughts of one person don't necessarily die when they die if there's ideas are culturally relevant.

571
01:05:06,43 --> 01:05:12,77
OK I don't know. Yeah. Conflict of the Yeah Yeah. Thank you. Don't ask you don't know what's good for you. Yeah.

572
01:05:12,95 --> 01:05:22,71
So that's that's not so young. Yeah I suppose that's where and then real is a shared experience comes in. That.

573
01:05:23,02 --> 01:05:31,91
Oh so well. So where does it come in memory as a shared experience comes in. The whole idea of thought.

574
01:05:32,14 --> 01:05:37,34
Although your source and your memories are individual that pestilent subjected to you.

575
01:05:37,46 --> 01:05:44,24
You can on the last share them with Alice and in multiple way you can share

576
01:05:44,24 --> 01:05:47,03
and then by discussing with one another like we're doing here.

577
01:05:47,38 --> 01:05:58,8
You can share them by creating something exquisite like a Beethoven symphony that neighbor's yard long.

578
01:06:00,24 --> 01:06:08,77
Long after Beethoven himself or a beautiful piece of beautiful piece of literature that.

579
01:06:09,02 --> 01:06:09,92
The author dies

580
01:06:09,92 --> 01:06:19,14
but nonetheless all of those thoughts as represented in the novel remain so in all those ways the thoughts can live on.

581
01:06:20,46 --> 01:06:26,85
Although of course there's a sense in which they live on in a sense in which they died because the subjective

582
01:06:26,85 --> 01:06:34,92
experience of the originator of the thought there is still it's a guide but the shared experience of the thoughts

583
01:06:34,92 --> 01:06:40,32
and the way in which thought and thoughts are interpreted by others and evolved

584
01:06:41,65 --> 01:06:46,06
and I suppose that's what history does you have these ideas that are recorded

585
01:06:46,89 --> 01:06:56,84
but actually as others really visit the history. Just as a memory is changed and it's really a city and so is history.

586
01:06:57,15 --> 01:07:06,95
So are the thoughts. So there's a level at which they live on but they don't they are changed but they also get richer.

587
01:07:09,05 --> 01:07:20,51
Somehow because right now we know this music in this music in this music and. Still we manage to do to make new.

588
01:07:21,73 --> 01:07:23,66
Music which is beautiful. Yeah.

589
01:07:24,26 --> 01:07:32,74
And the way in which it's interpreted will change because of the new technologies because of the new experiences. So.

590
01:07:33,71 --> 01:07:35,59
In a way these thoughts

591
01:07:35,59 --> 01:07:47,79
and these memories are much more than just this little snippet of factual accurate information about the past day

592
01:07:48,41 --> 01:07:49,77
infuse and.

593
01:07:51,13 --> 01:07:59,9
Pervade our history and our culture good and bad and good and bad and their evolution if you like as a species.

594
01:08:04,02 --> 01:08:13,59
So why do you want to fly. I don't know how to party in two words really.

595
01:08:16,22 --> 01:08:26,25
I've always been fascinated by what it's like to be. That I've always been fascinated with.

596
01:08:27,58 --> 01:08:33,52
Being able to move in a straight and she well instead of being stuck on Terra for.

597
01:08:39,99 --> 01:08:49,11
It's just feels like it's a fundamental feature of me and yet somehow I have difficulty verbalizing it.

598
01:08:49,55 --> 01:08:56,4
Perhaps because they kind of subjective experiences and thoughts associated with wanting to fly

599
01:08:57,04 --> 01:09:17,72
and wanting to be a bed are largely worthless. So what is it. For the on word. So I want. So let's let's hope.

600
01:09:21,64 --> 01:09:31,38
But somehow there must be origin of you as a thinking or I would like flight since the Freedom is not a minute.

601
01:09:31,68 --> 01:09:33,86
Whole idea of being able to.

602
01:09:36,2 --> 01:09:42,72
Explore the world from up above to be in the sky and look down and see more and see further.

603
01:09:48,16 --> 01:09:54,75
And to see that you could how much totally different perspective on how the world looks you still have this wish.

604
01:09:55,06 --> 01:10:11,39
Yeah man. Somehow I don't have words that really do it justice. It's this isn't what you have all your life.

605
01:10:15,69 --> 01:10:26,66
And how do you keep this a life or do you keep it a life or do you need just idea to keep on going. I turn like that.

606
01:10:26,69 --> 01:10:30,97
It's just part of me it's you know what I do.

607
01:10:31,44 --> 01:10:43,45
I don't think of flying like a burka Oh there's something in you inside you. Which in which. We're just friends.

608
01:10:43,57 --> 01:10:45,62
We all have our spirituality don't we.

609
01:10:45,62 --> 01:10:50,6
We all have those things that we identify as being sort of cool features of ourselves.

610
01:10:51,05 --> 01:11:00,79
For different people and different things but. Yeah. So.

611
01:11:01,37 --> 01:11:07,62
When we go to morrow to this lab we will see a lot of children.

612
01:11:08,2 --> 01:11:15,71
But yeah I know that we're doing children tomorrow on the day after our live also Scotland program.

613
01:11:18,67 --> 01:11:27,52
So what what do you hope to find out with these tests or. Procedures or.

614
01:11:27,87 --> 01:11:29,76
Well let's talk about that

615
01:11:29,76 --> 01:11:35,82
when we do that because there's lots of different one thought so I would rather clear direct with the stuff you have

616
01:11:35,82 --> 01:11:39,33
said it's almost it's going to be a bit there something just doesn't gel but I think.

617
01:11:40,09 --> 01:11:52,42
So when you dance you dance everywhere watching me. Well did you dance outside of it at home or at the lab or.

618
01:11:54,41 --> 01:12:06,88
At a club or this dancing you mean this tangled. Well you do that we go to the longest which I toss.

619
01:12:07,68 --> 01:12:15,86
And that's the main place you think. And we do them enough to form it says. I know that sometimes we don't know.

620
01:12:21,37 --> 01:12:24,86
The last question of why the tango because you're both not from Argentina.

621
01:12:25,87 --> 01:12:35,52
Gosh I don't know how to answer that you don't really it's her supposed movement I think it's such a beautiful dance

622
01:12:35,52 --> 01:12:38,58
because it's you so connected with it.

623
01:12:38,65 --> 01:12:43,93
Partly it's like they talk about it as being for legs

624
01:12:43,93 --> 01:12:50,11
and animal with four legs into beating hearts because they are so connected. So.

625
01:12:50,56 --> 01:12:53,89
You know there's many forms of dance and tight. I love that you know.

626
01:12:54,39 --> 01:12:56,76
Ballet salsa is great fun

627
01:12:56,76 --> 01:13:06,04
but there's something very powerful about it because of the connection you have with your partner so the leader

628
01:13:06,04 --> 01:13:10,6
and follow and the way in which he responds along to the music.

629
01:13:10,74 --> 01:13:19,23
I think it's very very special that every child just have this artist inside.

630
01:13:19,83 --> 01:13:24,72
So he deserves every artist every scientist have an artist inside.

631
01:13:25,14 --> 01:13:34,81
But it's not very common is it to be a scientist around the artist in residence somewhere

632
01:13:34,81 --> 01:13:38,24
and equally of course you know the way.

633
01:13:38,3 --> 01:13:44,84
Clive is artist in residence in the psychology department so I think we've got something that is quite unique.

634
01:13:45,25 --> 01:13:47,78
You need a hearing with artist in residence

635
01:13:47,78 --> 01:13:54,22
but typically that short term residences of three months old at most a year

636
01:13:54,22 --> 01:14:00,81
and usually it's the artist comes into your place talks to people and then creates a. Piece of art.

637
01:14:01,47 --> 01:14:07,1
Where is I think the captured thought the work that Clive and I do.

638
01:14:08,34 --> 01:14:16,56
Is truly collaborative it's not time comes and has a cup of coffee with me and then create something

639
01:14:16,56 --> 01:14:22,56
and I have a chat with time go off and do an experiment and occasionally we meet up and talk about them.

640
01:14:22,59 --> 01:14:25,43
I mean the whole project that we've been hearing it's is.

641
01:14:27,17 --> 01:14:41,13
Interwoven together so all our talks are written and jointly and performed jointly and it's it's. Fifty percent.

642
01:14:41,5 --> 01:14:52,73
You know you but think of it as being fifty percent making fifty percent Clive the really it's more like two percent

643
01:14:52,73 --> 01:15:00,93
and eighty two percent. Clive and ninety six percent. Nick inclined integrated and two percent.

644
01:15:00,94 --> 01:15:07,11
I'm only saying because you know obviously one voice is speaking while the other is silent and vice versa.

645
01:15:07,53 --> 01:15:16,84
But all of those all the thoughts and all the ideas are a collaborative mixture.

646
01:15:18,08 --> 01:15:25,32
And I hope and I think that as a result. It's like a gestalt phenomenon.

647
01:15:26,05 --> 01:15:33,97
We're being able to share more and do more than either of us could do you alone.

648
01:15:34,24 --> 01:15:38,61
I certainly feel that I wouldn't have got nearly so far in my thinking about science.

649
01:15:38,73 --> 01:15:44,47
If it hadn't been for Clive and I collaborating and it's not just on our discussion here in there.

650
01:15:44,56 --> 01:15:50,67
It really is this integrated into woven working together and thinking together.

651
01:15:52,18 --> 01:16:01,7
And trying to make new connections between disparate sources that alone. I wouldn't have thought of. But together.

652
01:16:02,21 --> 01:16:11,84
With Clive and we you know we can kind of push each other to explore further. So that's why I feel that it's.

653
01:16:13,45 --> 01:16:19,84
It's more than what you normally see in collaboration it's it's it's an integration.
