1
00:00:03,63 --> 00:00:14,28
So. The situation. So this village there. Is included.

2
00:00:14,48 --> 00:00:23,18
Is there it's included in the blues as well as the neighboring village so now we have about fourteen village here that

3
00:00:23,19 --> 00:00:28,78
are forming a bloc. That we were named the blues on this is very important.

4
00:00:28,8 --> 00:00:33,97
And then around you you have also some Montane but the longevity is a bit lower.

5
00:00:34,05 --> 00:00:37,09
So this is what I will name the light blue zone

6
00:00:37,09 --> 00:00:42,92
and the rest of the country is not a long living population they are not involved in the longevity.

7
00:00:43,31 --> 00:00:52,43
So this is really important this village is in the center of this area that is the blues.

8
00:00:52,45 --> 00:01:01,21
So if I want to pick all the village where we saw longevity I will say that all these villages are included.

9
00:01:01,66 --> 00:01:11,75
Also these one year and these one here so you have really an area like this where the longevity is the highest and

10
00:01:11,75 --> 00:01:18,9
when I did it for the first time I put it in blue. So this is really the highest blue zone of.

11
00:01:18,92 --> 00:01:25,45
Why does Aria the mountain around is a bit lower longevity it's lower blues on your C.

12
00:01:25,45 --> 00:01:29,01
and The rest of the country years and all the blues on this without on charity

13
00:01:29,01 --> 00:01:40,4
but this is really the main area of longevity. So tell me where did it. Where did it start.

14
00:01:42,35 --> 00:01:45,15
In fact there is a two step further.

15
00:01:45,45 --> 00:01:52,24
I was for the first time involved in centenarian study in Belgium in one thousand two with my friend.

16
00:01:52,26 --> 00:01:59,86
So I was already in the field of centenarians. But this story in there were sadly now started in.

17
00:02:00,68 --> 00:02:04,04
In October one thousand nine hundred ninety ninety nine

18
00:02:04,04 --> 00:02:13,86
and that was because my friend my new friend Johnny Pesky medical doctor from sari arrived and explained that it.

19
00:02:13,93 --> 00:02:21,38
This area. Man are living as long as women. What is really exceptional. But nobody wanted to believe this.

20
00:02:22,24 --> 00:02:27,72
So they decided I remember this meeting in October where you have to.

21
00:02:34,77 --> 00:02:40,82
It's clear that if you have a place where men have the possibility to live as long as women.

22
00:02:41,05 --> 00:02:44,55
This is unique on Earth because everywhere on earth.

23
00:02:44,83 --> 00:02:53,05
Women are I was a five star ten times in larger number compared to men and in this area you have equal number.

24
00:02:53,11 --> 00:02:56,88
So you have something to find something to explain. And this is unique.

25
00:02:56,88 --> 00:03:08,31
It's the only place on the on her Twitter I saw this type of work. It's clear that longevity fascinate me in that way.

26
00:03:08,46 --> 00:03:14,18
Why because for everybody. Living longer is something very attractive.

27
00:03:14,73 --> 00:03:20,43
In the recipe to live longer and the secret of longevity looking in all the newspaper in order.

28
00:03:20,49 --> 00:03:23,43
In National Geographic it attracts so many person.

29
00:03:23,61 --> 00:03:28,72
When I do a conference on longevity everybody is there at tending the conference very happy to listen.

30
00:03:28,95 --> 00:03:40,23
What are the secrets of Rajiv U.T. Why why. I don't want to leave it.

31
00:03:40,23 --> 00:03:44,53
OK but this is a very attractive topic

32
00:03:44,53 --> 00:03:52,72
and suddenly I don't know why because I was already in the field of centenarians but. If there is a secret.

33
00:03:52,93 --> 00:03:59,92
Do you have to find it on the scientific viewpoint you are to find something and it's a question I name it there.

34
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:06,13
Longevity question how can we explain that in this place men are living as long as women

35
00:04:06,13 --> 00:04:17,33
and there are so many centenarian in the cemetery. Why that's a question. They're honest with you. I am a scientist.

36
00:04:17,65 --> 00:04:22,00
OK. Which means that I need challenge.

37
00:04:22,01 --> 00:04:26,82
And I understand not only that I was personally interested

38
00:04:27,6 --> 00:04:32,64
but that a lot of people in the scientific world are interested with that topic.

39
00:04:32,68 --> 00:04:43,5
It's a very attractive topic even among scientists and we have no question and I will say that at the end of the day.

40
00:04:44,12 --> 00:04:52,94
I like to do it because it's interdisciplinary approach the secret of longevity is not only in one field in nutrition

41
00:04:53,72 --> 00:05:01,86
in social a gene anthropology as you know it has to bring together all people to try to find the solution.

42
00:05:02,07 --> 00:05:10,78
And the solution is not a simple one. If you find me a gene that explain ten per cent of the. Mortality longevity.

43
00:05:11,22 --> 00:05:12,58
I say I will not be satisfied.

44
00:05:13,04 --> 00:05:20,69
We have to find why there are three times or four times more men reaching ninety

45
00:05:20,69 --> 00:05:24,01
and one hundred than everywhere else that's not a small difference.

46
00:05:24,26 --> 00:05:31,42
This is a big difference and up to now we are not yet there. The question is still open and.

47
00:05:31,99 --> 00:05:38,49
I will say that for a scientist. When question are still open. It's better than one question our source.

48
00:05:38,53 --> 00:05:45,05
I will say that there is something to find and that's what research wants to do find a new line

49
00:05:45,05 --> 00:05:54,93
and if we find something then I will be very happy but maybe then it will be finished for my career. This is like this.

50
00:06:00,74 --> 00:06:24,36
We are coming into more every four years. When you see life like this.

51
00:06:24,38 --> 00:06:28,46
In fact you have to understand that the centenarian that we meet.

52
00:06:28,96 --> 00:06:29,5
We met

53
00:06:29,5 --> 00:06:39,03
and we are still looking today are exceptional person they were a person that has very difficult life in their early

54
00:06:39,03 --> 00:06:46,13
life. They have to work art. They were pastoring and so on and when they were sixty or seventy.

55
00:06:46,15 --> 00:06:48,59
At that moment they should have some problem with health

56
00:06:48,59 --> 00:06:54,14
but then the health service was improve which mean in the fifty in the sixty.

57
00:06:54,16 --> 00:06:58,49
They have the possibility to go to hospital they have a matter needed they have a lot of thing.

58
00:06:58,54 --> 00:07:08,12
So this is the conjunction of to change the fact that the old generation still work a lot and that a lot of effort

59
00:07:08,12 --> 00:07:09,16
and a scholar request.

60
00:07:09,77 --> 00:07:13,06
And that the modern world arrive with health and so on

61
00:07:13,06 --> 00:07:22,48
and my feeling is that these centenarian are not by us that they are the result of these two dimensions that in future

62
00:07:23,68 --> 00:07:25,05
like it is in our country.

63
00:07:25,08 --> 00:07:32,26
The centenarian will be more random centenarian by as a people that they skate to this or delay this type of disease

64
00:07:32,26 --> 00:07:32,82
and so on.

65
00:07:32,9 --> 00:07:37,95
So the future centenarian will not be the same as the one we can see in this village

66
00:07:38,91 --> 00:07:46,43
and I have already seen the situation in Okinawa in the UK in our There is no more new centenarian coming in large

67
00:07:46,43 --> 00:07:53,88
numbers because since forty five the Americans arrived there with the modern style lifestyle and so on.

68
00:07:54,07 --> 00:07:59,79
So the situation for the new JD they ration change fully and I'm sure that in future.

69
00:08:00,46 --> 00:08:09,62
The longevity exceptional and our will disappear and this is my problem. The young generation.

70
00:08:09,63 --> 00:08:16,34
If the young generation will transfer this treasure of longevity in all my talk in the municipality I say the most

71
00:08:16,34 --> 00:08:22,95
important is to understand that you have a treasure with this longevity your life style your food your all what is

72
00:08:22,95 --> 00:08:28,77
around you you F. To keep it that to transfer to the new generation so that you will keep this longevity.

73
00:08:29,18 --> 00:08:33,66
If not you will be as a very aware some random centenarian

74
00:08:33,66 --> 00:08:40,38
and nobody will take it take care of this person because they will be lost in the society in a modern society that does

75
00:08:40,38 --> 00:08:44,29
not take care about the whole person. So the situation is fully different.

76
00:08:44,33 --> 00:08:47,16
And what we try to do for example now in the US.

77
00:08:47,59 --> 00:08:52,51
And they try to do it would also in Costa Rica is to take the lesson from this area

78
00:08:52,51 --> 00:08:57,91
and to transfer in the modern world. Not to say OK go.

79
00:08:58,02 --> 00:09:07,43
SHEPPARTON Sardinia No this is not possible but look at what you are eating to exercise don't stop to do this.

80
00:09:07,63 --> 00:09:11,8
Physical exercise your brain social relationship.

81
00:09:11,86 --> 00:09:13,13
Take care of the old person

82
00:09:13,13 --> 00:09:20,29
and so all those point emerging from the lesson of this blue zone could be transferred to our society

83
00:09:20,29 --> 00:09:27,47
and this is the challenge. So our work here is not only for an a piece I was a very.

84
00:09:27,49 --> 00:09:32,76
Local exceptional situation is to see what these people.

85
00:09:34,19 --> 00:09:40,94
What is their behavior that can be transferred for the world modern society and and in the US This is very important.

86
00:09:41,32 --> 00:09:44,02
Again so basically against a lot of things like that

87
00:09:44,02 --> 00:09:50,52
and in our European country the same because people now are they at ninety or ninety five.

88
00:09:50,66 --> 00:09:57,68
They are put on the site just to wait to die. This is not correct here. The centenarian are on the top of the agenda.

89
00:09:58,26 --> 00:09:59,86
They are the key person they stay.

90
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:04,12
In the family they are on the calendar in the municipality they are in the photograph and so on.

91
00:10:04,25 --> 00:10:20,74
So the role of the oldest is fully different. And this is what we can do in our modern society. For our society. More.

92
00:10:20,75 --> 00:10:27,38
It means for example that. To put people certainly in the nursing home.

93
00:10:27,4 --> 00:10:33,23
It is consider in us in our society as the place where you will go to die. This is not correct.

94
00:10:33,51 --> 00:10:40,52
I have seen also in the US place where you may enter in a nursing home but by step. You go first.

95
00:10:40,8 --> 00:10:48,17
In the part where you stay with your spouse. Then when the spouse does appear you go to another place in the same.

96
00:10:48,7 --> 00:10:53,97
Surrounding And if suddenly you became a dependent you go still in another place

97
00:10:53,97 --> 00:11:01,48
but you are in a surrounding where you don't change the main problem now are they I have seen it in my country.

98
00:11:01,77 --> 00:11:08,28
You have a problem of health then quickly with your children. We have to take a decision.

99
00:11:08,56 --> 00:11:19,01
Poppy or mommy is to go to a nursing home and not given selected. They have to go in the only one that is available.

100
00:11:19,03 --> 00:11:26,08
I have the case in my family. One girl has to go there. Suddenly within two weeks the. This is not correct.

101
00:11:26,38 --> 00:11:35,8
What we what I named the last migration ration to the nursing home is the worst that can be expected by a person.

102
00:11:36,45 --> 00:11:45,01
You know during the life course the less the lower level of mobility is between sixty five

103
00:11:45,01 --> 00:11:48,26
and seventy five at that moment. Nobody wants to move.

104
00:11:48,8 --> 00:11:54,46
But after that there is what I named the last migration the migration when you are healthy.

105
00:11:54,59 --> 00:11:59,57
You are dependent either you go to your children. I go to you go to nursing home and so.

106
00:12:00,00 --> 00:12:03,25
But in our country we don't go anymore to the shelter because the parents

107
00:12:03,25 --> 00:12:06,51
and the Shouldn't does not want the children are not available

108
00:12:06,51 --> 00:12:09,92
and the parents that don't want to borrow their their parents.

109
00:12:09,96 --> 00:12:16,11
So you go to a nursing home in in my country three fourths of the oldest old are interesting.

110
00:12:16,66 --> 00:12:24,06
But all the nursing all are not the same you have to know that there are some nursing home that are wooly fully

111
00:12:24,06 --> 00:12:32,42
appropriate but most of them are not that good. They have no nursing only. There is nobody knows.

112
00:12:33,28 --> 00:12:39,51
What is the situation in this area is that you are close to your neighbor you are close to your family your daughter is

113
00:12:39,51 --> 00:12:46,6
living with you or in the neighboring house for example. Marco ear is going to spend the night with is uncle.

114
00:12:47,05 --> 00:12:57,69
Once or twice a week. There is a solidarity for sorry that it is in the village and nobody knows it.

115
00:12:58,89 --> 00:13:08,96
So what makes you winners. I will say that I like to enter in a field where there is.

116
00:13:10,05 --> 00:13:13,85
That is not usual for all the demographer or the scientists.

117
00:13:14,49 --> 00:13:21,7
Very often I see that colleagues will jump on a topic that is already written by other scientists

118
00:13:21,7 --> 00:13:27,22
and just just say at the small information. In this topic.

119
00:13:27,41 --> 00:13:29,72
It's a new one for the new one

120
00:13:29,72 --> 00:13:35,6
and it's difficult because you have it took me ten years to prove that it's a very important topic

121
00:13:35,6 --> 00:13:42,3
but nowadays I have seen it this week three three meeting that I have just beginning of this month's I have a meeting

122
00:13:42,3 --> 00:13:48,3
in Tallinn in Vienna and important at the three meeting there were a lot of interest to this new concept

123
00:13:48,3 --> 00:13:51,71
and that brings me. The feeling that. OK.

124
00:13:51,76 --> 00:13:59,76
It was difficult to convince people convince research that is a very useful topic but after some times when you.

125
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:09,2
You keep it you succeed. And that's in all my career I did not want to have an easy way you if you made.

126
00:14:09,2 --> 00:14:11,53
Shoes more difficult way but at the end of the day.

127
00:14:12,08 --> 00:14:20,05
You may succeed and then it's really wonderful to see the reaction of research and so on. That's very important topic.

128
00:14:20,94 --> 00:14:35,66
We are talking about you are right I will say that among the scientists.

129
00:14:36,1 --> 00:14:44,42
There are very often different opportunities one opportunity is to jump in a topic that is already on the agenda of a

130
00:14:44,42 --> 00:14:50,79
lot of research and then you deal with the same thing you try to do a new experimental repeat Kate as we say

131
00:14:50,79 --> 00:14:53,42
and you bring some small additional information.

132
00:14:53,86 --> 00:14:59,13
Another situation is when you develop and you enter in a new field in a new topic

133
00:14:59,92 --> 00:15:07,1
and that's what I did here at the beginning putting on the table of the scientists a new topic a new idea a new concept

134
00:15:07,1 --> 00:15:13,08
is really just for two reason they don't believe or they are jailers that that's the reason.

135
00:15:13,14 --> 00:15:17,49
So for me I have a lot of difficulty but I keep the line

136
00:15:18,32 --> 00:15:24,81
and may say that after fifty years the how everybody respect this concept of population on charity.

137
00:15:25,05 --> 00:15:29,73
The fact that blue zone are something very interesting and there is something to take from this

138
00:15:29,73 --> 00:15:35,53
and I have a meeting at the beginning of the months in Tallinn then in Vienna and in Porto at that meeting.

139
00:15:35,76 --> 00:15:38,36
I talk about Luzon and there were a lot of interests

140
00:15:38,36 --> 00:15:44,85
and people want really to know what is specific in these blue zone what what do you bring as new information.

141
00:15:45,56 --> 00:15:51,64
So it's difficult in the carrier but when you are explorer you go in and and now in the world

142
00:15:51,64 --> 00:15:58,5
and that's for me attractive you discover a place where there is no other scientists already in the field.

143
00:15:58,53 --> 00:16:07,51
It's difficult but then. Brings you a lot of I would say this positive sensation.

144
00:16:09,82 --> 00:16:18,24
Though the blue zone now we have four Bluto knocking in our carry on Greece Costa Rica in Costa Rica and Sardinia

145
00:16:18,24 --> 00:16:23,48
and now I am always working on the possibility to find a new blue zone.

146
00:16:23,53 --> 00:16:31,26
So I have been lost once in Caucasus in Georgia. And I visited a hidden valley that was supposed to be wonderful.

147
00:16:31,39 --> 00:16:40,15
That has been set in the past in the Caucasus. There are people living longer. So I went there. It was attractive.

148
00:16:40,17 --> 00:16:49,4
Logical viewpoint but I visited six centenarian and I did survey I check the archive at the end of my day.

149
00:16:49,65 --> 00:16:56,79
I have to consider that all of them exaggerate their age. So in fact my conclusion is that there is no exception.

150
00:16:57,09 --> 00:17:02,59
The longevity in Caucasus. So I close the door. Go cause this cannot be a new blue zone.

151
00:17:02,64 --> 00:17:06,67
Now I have another one on the agenda this is Cuba. And Cuba.

152
00:17:06,89 --> 00:17:13,62
I'm sure there is I'm sick I'm sure there is a place that I have seen a place nearby something Clara where there is a

153
00:17:13,62 --> 00:17:21,48
lot of sun that I visited among the cemetery. I have some contact with the data but to prove that this is a blue zone.

154
00:17:21,56 --> 00:17:27,35
I need strong started stickle data that's very important and these data are not available.

155
00:17:27,76 --> 00:17:34,28
That's the problem because the government of Cuba did not give the green light. You see in Cuba.

156
00:17:34,45 --> 00:17:41,62
If you don't have a sign from the top you will not have access to data that are a bit more sensitive.

157
00:17:41,87 --> 00:17:43,14
And so I am waiting.

158
00:17:43,65 --> 00:17:44,61
The door is open

159
00:17:44,61 --> 00:17:53,23
but what is important if I succeed to prove that Cuba is a blues with health expenditure that is one thousand less than

160
00:17:53,23 --> 00:18:01,13
in the US to go in the US and to tell it you need to have a strong argument you need. To have strong evidence.

161
00:18:01,5 --> 00:18:08,73
So I will not do it until I have my data and my proof but if it so it will be a boom.

162
00:18:08,84 --> 00:18:15,73
Because you may show that you may reach one hundred in large number in a country where you give only some small

163
00:18:15,73 --> 00:18:21,18
preventive and know all these technical of medicine the new medicine

164
00:18:21,18 --> 00:18:29,36
and nope sick yeah three No sickle organs a lot of things are missing in Cuba and the longevity is there.

165
00:18:29,37 --> 00:18:33,54
I have seen centenarian that has no freezer at all.

166
00:18:33,54 --> 00:18:38,45
There is no possibility to keep the food and they give me another nasty

167
00:18:38,45 --> 00:18:44,1
and never ate so wonderful are in us the so far just piece of food.

168
00:18:44,12 --> 00:18:52,06
The houses we serve but the smile on this wonderful so huge children smiling all over the world.

169
00:18:52,34 --> 00:19:05,53
These are not the one that are in the richer country that's important. Now you want to know. I have another viewpoint.

170
00:19:07,42 --> 00:19:12,59
All depends what you are doing in one day. OK And I understand that.

171
00:19:12,82 --> 00:19:18,51
Some people at the end of the day may not conclude that they did something on that day.

172
00:19:18,68 --> 00:19:23,5
Why when I see or what I'm trying to do in one day some time.

173
00:19:23,53 --> 00:19:29,25
It's so heavy and so full that I think it's impossible to reach one hundred like this.

174
00:19:29,47 --> 00:19:33,91
Seem that there is a different speed or a different level of activity

175
00:19:33,91 --> 00:19:43,68
and so on so that finally I know some singers die at fifty but they have a full life full full full Y.

176
00:19:43,68 --> 00:19:48,52
Other person die after one hundred and did not sing along side their life.

177
00:19:48,58 --> 00:19:57,56
So you see there is a balance when you are doing study on the whole the old you have all the same time the idea.

178
00:19:57,69 --> 00:20:01,68
I will be there soon. And. That brings me a lot of thought.

179
00:20:01,84 --> 00:20:08,1
Sometimes negative so I have to fight against the negative but I have seen this person I saw the person monitors

180
00:20:08,1 --> 00:20:08,6
and sixteen.

181
00:20:08,64 --> 00:20:16,96
She is alone all the day I saw the mother in law of my brother she is one o one and that I discuss with her.

182
00:20:17,24 --> 00:20:23,4
And I say when you are awake during the night. What this in your brain. And then she say.

183
00:20:23,67 --> 00:20:27,06
Very simply I am praying not nothing else

184
00:20:27,06 --> 00:20:35,86
but for me it's a question what is going on in the brain of these persons that are awake and alone a full day

185
00:20:37,07 --> 00:20:44,25
and is it depression or. They are just looking on their life and and pray as she said she prayed.

186
00:20:44,32 --> 00:20:53,18
That's very important for me that it put a question because the longevity is in front of all of us why marriage

187
00:20:53,18 --> 00:21:03,92
children and so on. This is beyond but longevity is in front of me.

188
00:21:06,78 --> 00:21:18,74
I will say spontaneously I the moment that I prefer when I feel really. The most happy. It's two different things.

189
00:21:19,85 --> 00:21:26,05
When I see the smile of a small child. In the Dunn country and so on.

190
00:21:26,28 --> 00:21:29,68
Smiling and I photograph your children that are so wonderful.

191
00:21:30,1 --> 00:21:37,4
Or when I see a landscape like this very quiet and some landscape I have been for example in India in Kashmir

192
00:21:37,4 --> 00:21:46,57
and so you have this beautiful landscape and then the problem of my fate race and I I say it's so beautiful

193
00:21:46,57 --> 00:21:52,59
and for me it's these are the most important moment in my life to see those children

194
00:21:52,59 --> 00:21:58,38
and the wonderful landscape that God gave us and that's very important for.

195
00:22:01,26 --> 00:22:08,94
I will say that the gray wanted to say that we were Rishi easily one of the ten fifty two hundred

196
00:22:08,94 --> 00:22:10,87
and even one thousand a year.

197
00:22:10,89 --> 00:22:18,08
I am not convince because you say that with the new medicine you may repair everything on your body. OK but.

198
00:22:18,57 --> 00:22:23,27
I will say that if you have a car and the tire is flat you repair it.

199
00:22:23,42 --> 00:22:29,83
But if it is a north tire then you will have a new problem just a bit later.

200
00:22:31,2 --> 00:22:31,95
I think it's a dream

201
00:22:31,95 --> 00:22:39,04
and with this is a point that we are discussing very often between scientists is it an upper limit of the life.

202
00:22:39,41 --> 00:22:45,95
Or it will be an open door to one thousand years old I am convinced that there is an upper limit

203
00:22:45,95 --> 00:22:56,31
and our day people does not reach more than one sixteen. One seventeen is the maximum and the mom was one twenty two.

204
00:22:57,58 --> 00:23:02,59
There is those change that she will be replaced very soon that that's my point

205
00:23:03,32 --> 00:23:11,63
but this is a very become petition between different tire theory of demographic because some of these say OK there is

206
00:23:11,63 --> 00:23:15,5
no limit and others say there is a limit and that's important.

207
00:23:17,93 --> 00:23:22,69
When there is no limit it will be in that they could be a person who will reach one forty

208
00:23:23,71 --> 00:23:30,08
but to reach one forty you need to have a number of centenarian that is very very large because the probability to

209
00:23:30,08 --> 00:23:31,51
reach one forty is very low.

210
00:23:31,59 --> 00:23:37,3
So the more you are centenarian the more you will have the possibility to go to higher page

211
00:23:37,3 --> 00:23:42,89
and that's why in France for example there are more centenarians and there is one fifteen in Belgium.

212
00:23:43,13 --> 00:23:47,65
It's more difficult. We reach only one to one and twelve in the Netherlands.

213
00:23:48,1 --> 00:23:50,37
You have a person who reach one fifteen

214
00:23:50,37 --> 00:23:55,04
but this is a casually it's not due to the fact that you have a large number of centenarian But this is random.

215
00:23:55,19 --> 00:23:59,74
So I think we discussed just recently to reassure.

216
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:03,26
Eight You need to really a large number of centenarians

217
00:24:03,26 --> 00:24:11,84
and at one moment the total population on earth is not enough so that you will have the possibility to have one person

218
00:24:11,84 --> 00:24:18,58
for example one fifty. So this is a question. So on the probability viewpoint. It's possible.

219
00:24:18,97 --> 00:24:24,19
But you need to apply this probability to initial number of person

220
00:24:24,19 --> 00:24:33,33
and nine billion of population on Herc are not enough to get one person reaching one forty on one fifty.

221
00:24:33,34 --> 00:25:07,85
That's the point when you look at religion actually. What's happening. So in fact.

222
00:25:07,86 --> 00:25:15,52
We we were going from village to village and when you have a new village like this one.

223
00:25:15,68 --> 00:25:22,9
Then you have to assess the level of this village and to assess if the level is high enough to be a blue zone.

224
00:25:22,96 --> 00:25:27,52
So now we will check this village and then we will go to another one.

225
00:25:27,52 --> 00:25:27,8
And finally

226
00:25:28,55 --> 00:25:35,83
when the we were able to put on a map all these village we form really an area that we named the blue zone that's very

227
00:25:35,83 --> 00:25:39,66
important when you look at that.

228
00:25:41,35 --> 00:25:47,62
This really is part of the blue zone yes yes it's proven that means that we have already checked the data.

229
00:25:47,94 --> 00:25:51,09
The next one will be also on the same situation.

230
00:25:51,11 --> 00:25:56,83
So we have fourteen village that has been composing the blue zone one by one we put them together and

231
00:25:56,84 --> 00:26:04,94
when you look at the villages. Forty one that are rather different.

232
00:26:05,62 --> 00:26:10,3
I will say that there is not a clear difference there.

233
00:26:10,36 --> 00:26:17,95
It's a gradient which means that at one moment you have to do the border to event if I What is the real arresting blue

234
00:26:17,95 --> 00:26:19,07
zone the high blue zone

235
00:26:19,07 --> 00:26:24,23
and then you have the Light Blues Although around that is all the mountain is part of Sardinia

236
00:26:24,23 --> 00:26:30,05
and the rest of studying are included in society including all the city.

237
00:26:30,06 --> 00:26:42,46
This is the number one what makes this is the level of longevity the number of centenarian that you found divided by

238
00:26:42,46 --> 00:26:46,26
the number of newborn months and you really go in these villages really low

239
00:26:47,93 --> 00:26:54,84
and it's because of different lives different at that that's really the question mark.

240
00:26:54,93 --> 00:27:00,77
Now the fact that we didn't defy a blue zone and not blue so now we are comparing the life.

241
00:27:00,99 --> 00:27:09,35
The food and Vironment everything in the two part and then we will see what are the biggest difference

242
00:27:09,35 --> 00:27:14,74
and I already understood that one of the big difference is the proportion of shepherds.

243
00:27:14,78 --> 00:27:21,13
So the role of shepherd in the past because in the moment in most of these people where are shepherds.

244
00:27:21,23 --> 00:27:25,00
Why if you go to the plain there was no shepherd. This is not the same.

245
00:27:25,48 --> 00:27:30,93
They are doing agriculture they are growing cereal and so on. This is not the same way of living.

246
00:27:32,36 --> 00:27:39,05
So the difference is that the main difference for us up to now that's why the blue zone is concentrated in the area

247
00:27:39,05 --> 00:27:48,53
where you have this pastoralism where you have everybody is working on the most in the thing that's inside.

248
00:27:49,1 --> 00:27:55,45
And then it may be that you have the same in another country but. This is a question mark.

249
00:27:55,7 --> 00:28:01,93
Which means that is it normal that with the same proportion of Shepherd in another country.

250
00:28:02,24 --> 00:28:13,74
We don't have the longevity so this is a question mark. OK. If you come to be a shepherd.

251
00:28:13,75 --> 00:28:16,45
I'm not sure you will live longer.

252
00:28:16,47 --> 00:28:22,78
Because you should be born a year you should live exactly as they live years so it's a very complex thing.

253
00:28:22,81 --> 00:28:25,54
So I don't recommend to come here to be Shepherd.

254
00:28:26,04 --> 00:28:38,00
First of all nobody is shepherd now with a there are a limited number of shepherds. That's the village.

255
00:28:38,02 --> 00:28:43,07
This village is part of the blue zone which means that we have been there. We check the data.

256
00:28:43,49 --> 00:28:50,37
And we prove that the level of longevity is really really higher than the Italian average there is a huge difference

257
00:28:50,37 --> 00:28:51,13
between the two.

258
00:28:51,19 --> 00:28:59,18
So we put it on the map and putting all the village together we shaped the blue zone

259
00:28:59,18 --> 00:29:06,42
and so this village is part of the blues. Well. So the first time that.

260
00:29:06,43 --> 00:29:12,43
We went from village to village at one moment I decided to put on the maps all the village

261
00:29:12,43 --> 00:29:21,69
and I mark in blue all the villages so that it wasn't a blue area on the map then I decide with Johnny that it was the

262
00:29:21,69 --> 00:29:32,43
blues of. And from that time when we were discussing between us we always talk about the blues on.

263
00:29:32,45 --> 00:29:46,25
This is a guy just at one and a few days forty one and that and a few last you know how many centennial year.

264
00:29:46,7 --> 00:29:53,23
A priori you may find in the rules Senator Reed thirty at least thirty plus those who are alive

265
00:29:53,23 --> 00:29:55,21
and pose preserve those who died.

266
00:29:55,46 --> 00:30:01,99
Outside of the village in total you have more than forty two centenarian and then longer twenty forty two.

267
00:30:02,05 --> 00:30:03,76
They are twenty two male.

268
00:30:04,37 --> 00:30:15,79
And that's usually you should find among the centenarian eight women for one man only here you have the same number

269
00:30:15,79 --> 00:30:23,16
that's crazy. I have another one look at this one for example this year fourteen out of. Exactly.

270
00:30:23,19 --> 00:30:29,78
He was one of one when he died. And this is a man this is a girl. You see but.

271
00:30:30,48 --> 00:30:38,95
We should do a meet in a hurry in the cemetery to show all those who are so you look in here you have again this is

272
00:30:38,95 --> 00:30:45,02
eighty nine. This ninety and it's always like this eighty two eighty six.

273
00:30:46,75 --> 00:30:51,01
You know this is ninety two and No ninety eight ninety eight.

274
00:30:52,96 --> 00:31:00,9
This is for me when I visit the cemetery I want to feel this and if I come here. I will directly say there.

275
00:31:00,99 --> 00:31:10,13
Something to do the research look this one is eighty seven and then you have every where. Ninety eight.

276
00:31:10,3 --> 00:31:16,37
Usually the normal age of that is around eighty eighty two and so on.

277
00:31:16,43 --> 00:31:22,16
When you start to have a lot of the Nashville area and or something like that then it's really amazing

278
00:31:22,16 --> 00:31:27,74
and then you you say OK it's was due to start the research to understand what happens here

279
00:31:27,74 --> 00:31:34,81
and here I discover it directly and my friend who work with me is a specialist of cemetery.

280
00:31:34,97 --> 00:31:39,86
He is jumping in all the cemetery and once he was even blocking the cemetery because they close the door

281
00:31:39,86 --> 00:31:42,24
and throw a clock and he was not able to go out

282
00:31:42,24 --> 00:31:47,46
but he did systematically all the cemetery of the surrounding to check those who reach ninety

283
00:31:48,32 --> 00:31:58,13
and that that's very useful people right. During one year. Last summer. Since I was there beginning of March.

284
00:31:59,6 --> 00:32:07,89
There is ten people who die and among these they are four or six five Nigerian who die above ninety

285
00:32:08,92 --> 00:32:16,11
and only one who die younger seventy but I would say that it's all above eighty five.

286
00:32:16,24 --> 00:32:20,4
OK but at the same time you have very limited number of newborns.

287
00:32:21,00 --> 00:32:28,14
Which means that the population of the village is definitely going down quite quickly by not you will increase negative

288
00:32:28,14 --> 00:32:28,79
not your increase

289
00:32:28,79 --> 00:32:34,86
and there's there is no immigration because the young people in one out of to decide to leave the village.

290
00:32:35,12 --> 00:32:40,77
So the population of the village is going down slowly and slowly every year you have less and less people.

291
00:32:41,06 --> 00:32:48,69
That's that's a problem for the survival of this type of place because more that new wall

292
00:32:48,69 --> 00:33:04,14
and more immigration than immigration. That. The canal Kate Pearcy Grandy so no town taken to an IRA early..

293
00:33:00,99 --> 00:33:04,14
OK John Avalon are joining up with her H.K.

294
00:33:05,54 --> 00:33:12,68
The rest gameport on the part of the SHE I call born when I was a point I joined of course

295
00:33:12,68 --> 00:33:18,68
and I thought I really close enough to what I came for a fruit on. Pursuit of the larger.

296
00:33:19,39 --> 00:33:25,9
If I drove for a drive to Colorado uranium and that orgy. I got to hear a record.

297
00:33:26,45 --> 00:33:29,69
Because I go to share some of that old time to acknowledge.

298
00:33:29,94 --> 00:33:36,84
If you've obeyed if I ever say show you know go to a club or go in each that day

299
00:33:36,84 --> 00:33:41,64
and I just thought that there were a lot a whole lot they missed that they should give up

300
00:33:41,64 --> 00:33:53,75
and if I should have any have any problem with evil. Be very happy to minister Henri Paul and to be appointed.

301
00:33:53,77 --> 00:34:11,94
So no need to. Though. Are maybe a pastoring from the past story personality Jelani a planetary aboard.

302
00:34:13,01 --> 00:34:17,41
My gender we're going to rally. Look Past story.

303
00:34:17,6 --> 00:34:24,79
So not to look to the law no Alistair Oh no not be like Gandhi highly bad also.

304
00:34:24,92 --> 00:34:31,49
No not really wanted todo you have to retrain Jay one time then you know Jane to well go that way saying it's about

305
00:34:31,49 --> 00:34:31,71
time.

306
00:34:32,14 --> 00:34:38,27
Or like a plan which I don't I can't just yeah I was not being just other you reject at the very minute an hour later I

307
00:34:38,27 --> 00:34:41,92
