1
00:00:00,27 --> 00:00:02,32
Mom Carolyn I called Neda and.

2
00:00:03,26 --> 00:00:08,08
I'm the director of research center in virtual reality called emerging analytics center

3
00:00:08,58 --> 00:00:11,81
and we are part of the University of Arkansas in the talk

4
00:00:12,2 --> 00:00:18,81
and a lot of people ask why are you in the third Rock Arkansas doing something that is so much.

5
00:00:19,72 --> 00:00:22,02
Then we can advance and mother

6
00:00:22,6 --> 00:00:29,03
and the reason for it is because this is a tremendously good infrastructure here to do what I do

7
00:00:29,45 --> 00:00:35,3
and that is actually a lot of energy and enthusiasm to support the work that I do

8
00:00:35,6 --> 00:00:38,9
and they're producing it is for us to do.

9
00:00:39,42 --> 00:00:44,64
Interesting projects and more unique things with less restrictions not knowing so much.

10
00:00:45,03 --> 00:00:52,53
Legal restrictions but almost intellectual restrictions you know because here. There is almost nothing so.

11
00:00:52,57 --> 00:00:58,08
So there is no preconceptions there is no baggage of any kind.

12
00:00:58,37 --> 00:01:04,92
You know there is no things have to be done in a certain way so to me that's always been very exciting you know.

13
00:01:06,09 --> 00:01:13,04
It's new and and and we are the cool group on the compass you know where the exciting group on campus

14
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:14,7
and for me it's always a good thing.

15
00:01:14,7 --> 00:01:14,95
And so

16
00:01:14,95 --> 00:01:24,17
and this is not the first time in my career I have always been in universities where you would not respect to have the

17
00:01:24,17 --> 00:01:25,1
kind of work that I do

18
00:01:25,1 --> 00:01:33,67
and this really like us is a lot more fun is harder too because we run into some complications we don't have a lot of

19
00:01:33,67 --> 00:01:38,8
colleagues. That we can talk to or an environment.

20
00:01:38,99 --> 00:01:43,72
Were there is a lot of knowledge on the area that we do research of

21
00:01:43,72 --> 00:01:49,69
but at the same time it's a lot of fun because like I said we have no constraints of any kind on what we do.

22
00:01:52,7 --> 00:02:00,52
Pretty much you know we're kind of. By union into some a stand and we hear our head. In the wall.

23
00:02:00,55 --> 00:02:02,44
We had to hear and hear and hear

24
00:02:02,44 --> 00:02:09,9
and eventually we break the world because like I say sometimes we're entirely on our own in some situations

25
00:02:09,9 --> 00:02:16,52
but at the same time because we are unique group in the campus

26
00:02:16,52 --> 00:02:20,81
and in many cases in the state that we are in in the United States.

27
00:02:20,85 --> 00:02:26,3
Then we get a lot of support and we get a lot of encouragement

28
00:02:26,3 --> 00:02:32,77
and we get a lot of positive reactions to a lot of the things that we do.

29
00:02:33,31 --> 00:02:41,88
And also we give a large part because around us we are always generating other opportunities for example.

30
00:02:42,56 --> 00:02:46,2
Businesses that will now consider coming into Little Rock.

31
00:02:46,43 --> 00:02:53,63
They consider setting up here because we are here so for them having a relationship with my group.

32
00:02:54,01 --> 00:02:54,8
Might be very exciting

33
00:02:54,8 --> 00:03:00,01
and they were like Oh we know we're not thinking of going to Arkansas we were thinking of maybe going to California

34
00:03:00,01 --> 00:03:04,89
or Boston or something like that but your group being they are.

35
00:03:05,07 --> 00:03:14,97
Is is for us is actually wonderful because the cost of living is a lot lower the ability for us to financially support

36
00:03:14,97 --> 00:03:19,62
the company is is much much easier than the disorder areas

37
00:03:19,62 --> 00:03:27,53
and at the same time have we have the same intellectual quality on our relationship with our universities so much of

38
00:03:27,53 --> 00:03:33,58
the beneficial relationship for us to be in in one aspect of a university.

39
00:03:34,54 --> 00:03:45,27
What it's all is my science I don't know a lot of people ask me that question

40
00:03:45,27 --> 00:03:51,44
and I'm not sure if I'm actually a scientist myself because I'm more training from engineering

41
00:03:51,44 --> 00:03:59,21
and engineers were always sort of the We Are Scientists because we're always very practical. So.

42
00:04:00,09 --> 00:04:02,03
I think our science is more.

43
00:04:02,33 --> 00:04:13,69
Our ability to find the root of our problem and find some ways to solve the problem or at least to make a better man

44
00:04:13,69 --> 00:04:17,89
or be deeply deeply theoretical a lot of the things that we do

45
00:04:18,1 --> 00:04:22,13
but they are deeply technically challenging the things that we do so.

46
00:04:22,16 --> 00:04:27,68
Sometimes is a struggle because we might be doing something that is unique.

47
00:04:27,92 --> 00:04:32,29
Nobody has done it before is incredibly hard to solve the problem.

48
00:04:32,82 --> 00:04:38,73
But in my now feel that we just discover a new way of how the galaxies were formed.

49
00:04:38,77 --> 00:04:47,95
You know or or some new philosophy cow theory of how our soul relates to the. Universe or something like that.

50
00:04:48,01 --> 00:05:01,58
You know. So we are we are much more practical and down to and a specific point that needs a solution so but what.

51
00:05:02,87 --> 00:05:10,67
Yes I have my theories and myself personally I think.

52
00:05:11,39 --> 00:05:19,14
So on my entire career I have been a little bit of an outsider to the virtual reality science community because I

53
00:05:19,14 --> 00:05:26,72
always thought differently than the main trend of thoughts. Even today.

54
00:05:26,92 --> 00:05:29,52
You know if you talk about virtual reality today

55
00:05:29,52 --> 00:05:36,18
when somebody says do you know what virtual reality is about immediately they're going to identify with put in some

56
00:05:36,18 --> 00:05:42,55
sort of goggles on your face. And look around some beautiful landscape or something like that.

57
00:05:42,87 --> 00:05:51,57
That's not exactly what I do because to me virtual reality is the ability to create some world in the computer that

58
00:05:51,57 --> 00:05:58,84
again solves a problem. And in order to do that sometimes you have to be multiple people share in the environment.

59
00:06:00,01 --> 00:06:08,04
With their own bodies not not sort of virtual representation of myself in the world but actually myself physically

60
00:06:08,3 --> 00:06:12,00
and better in the virtual world so I want to see your face and your face

61
00:06:12,00 --> 00:06:18,63
and your face while I'm seeing the virtual world. So my work is more about building larger.

62
00:06:23,57 --> 00:06:35,83
Well when when again when you talk about virtual reality with the majority of the community with the body.

63
00:06:38,26 --> 00:06:42,73
But I do here. I'm going to tell you what happened to me when I first overture reality.

64
00:06:42,87 --> 00:06:47,29
Let's go back to the beginning you know when I first saw virtual reality in one nine hundred ninety one.

65
00:06:47,5 --> 00:06:50,87
I had the same experience everybody is having today.

66
00:06:50,97 --> 00:06:57,44
You know somebody put some goggles on my face and I started looking around some beautiful world.

67
00:06:58,18 --> 00:07:00,42
And of course I was a young student at the time

68
00:07:00,42 --> 00:07:05,27
and never seen it before so why did I do the same as everybody does today.

69
00:07:08,79 --> 00:07:09,04
You know

70
00:07:09,04 --> 00:07:18,31
but like with everything else after that it's all over the excitement is over then you start thinking What is this

71
00:07:18,31 --> 00:07:23,54
thing really what is this thing. You know what what us and again I'm thinking as an engineer.

72
00:07:23,84 --> 00:07:32,97
What is this thing doing for me other than just wow. So when I start thinking. First of all our US.

73
00:07:33,37 --> 00:07:42,43
You know I'm not myself anymore. Here. Because when I'm in right here in this room with you. I see my hands.

74
00:07:42,45 --> 00:07:51,36
I see my legs. I see a little bit of my hearing here. When I put goggles. I lost all that immediately.

75
00:07:51,37 --> 00:07:53,08
I'm not myself anymore.

76
00:07:53,23 --> 00:07:59,76
I don't know how big something is I don't know how close something is because I can tell this table this year because I.

77
00:08:00,01 --> 00:08:04,61
And see my hand going towards the table so that gives me a sense of space

78
00:08:04,61 --> 00:08:08,58
and relationship in the virtual world I'm trying to grab something.

79
00:08:09,47 --> 00:08:14,77
But I don't see anything at the most I see some floating hand that is not connected to my body

80
00:08:14,96 --> 00:08:17,96
and is not even my own hand because most of the virtual environments.

81
00:08:18,28 --> 00:08:20,07
They give you a male hand you know

82
00:08:20,26 --> 00:08:25,96
and I'm a woman I have a little redness I know that's not even my hand so I lose myself their mom

83
00:08:25,96 --> 00:08:28,44
and I walk in there were charges because that's number one number two.

84
00:08:29,92 --> 00:08:40,02
As humans we like to talk to people we are very social individuals were very social. I don't know. I put my goggles on.

85
00:08:40,88 --> 00:08:44,58
I lost all of you as well because I might be seeing something

86
00:08:44,58 --> 00:08:52,61
and I might be sent look at that you don't see because you don't have the guy was on what I see you don't see that

87
00:08:52,61 --> 00:08:57,87
there's no way for me to share that with you in the same way I shared this room with you.

88
00:08:58,23 --> 00:09:06,34
So to me those those kinds of things since I was very very very young were very unknowing about the way virtual reality

89
00:09:06,48 --> 00:09:10,97
was being approached by in general by the research community.

90
00:09:11,58 --> 00:09:20,61
So so I thought about what can be done to bring myself into the virtual space.

91
00:09:21,53 --> 00:09:27,34
What can I do to do that and I was very fortunate because I was a start in my Ph D.

92
00:09:28,36 --> 00:09:34,56
On the professor that I was working away it gave me a lot of freedom to explore whatever I wanted to do.

93
00:09:34,93 --> 00:09:37,61
He has some say ideas of what he wanted to do.

94
00:09:39,3 --> 00:09:41,63
And I was I started doing what he wanted me to do

95
00:09:41,66 --> 00:09:46,4
but at the same time in part of that I started spending mending with some of the scenes that I was interested on

96
00:09:47,22 --> 00:09:54,56
and on the line. The professor was gracious enough to recognise that the direction that I was going in was exciting.

97
00:09:54,71 --> 00:10:04,32
Let me run with those ideas. So I end up developing. In a sense a goggle big enough that it was the size of a room.

98
00:10:04,56 --> 00:10:14,5
So instead of putting that on your head. Yeah I build a case. A student used today not twenty something years later.

99
00:10:14,85 --> 00:10:22,49
So so you walk into this room so because your body comes with you into the virtual environment your friends come with

100
00:10:22,49 --> 00:10:27,56
you into a better environment and you'll see that tomorrow when we got to the laboratory you know so you come with me.

101
00:10:28,12 --> 00:10:30,34
And then I would be saying Look at Dan.

102
00:10:31,2 --> 00:10:37,22
And you see my finger pointing at a virtual object the same way I say look at this table or something like that.

103
00:10:37,56 --> 00:10:48,17
So the social element is part of the virtual spin as without any recreate virtually of yourself which is what people do

104
00:10:48,2 --> 00:10:55,58
these days when you share a virtual environment. They recreate yourself in the virtual environment. But that's not you.

105
00:10:56,38 --> 00:11:00,33
That's a puppet represents you or an avatar. I guess the right term.

106
00:11:00,82 --> 00:11:05,15
So for me like I said back in one thousand nine hundred one.

107
00:11:05,91 --> 00:11:08,78
You know everybody's going this way in virtual reality

108
00:11:08,78 --> 00:11:14,99
and I'm going that way so that has been always a little bit challenging to be.

109
00:11:16,63 --> 00:11:22,64
It was well it does what I mentioned earlier you know I have been very very successful on what I have done

110
00:11:23,12 --> 00:11:30,2
but my work has been always been recognised as science because it doesn't feed the pattern

111
00:11:31,28 --> 00:11:36,94
or the moment that the community is the majority of the community is going

112
00:11:36,94 --> 00:11:44,44
but at the same time there were that I have done has had a significant impact in the industry today.

113
00:11:45,43 --> 00:11:52,98
A lot of the car companies for example have caves a different stages of the design and manufacturing of cars.

114
00:11:53,84 --> 00:11:59,95
They are industry uses of the cave not the cave us it was originally created but.

115
00:12:00,26 --> 00:12:07,08
But this concept of having large spaces that you share the mercy of a space.

116
00:12:07,53 --> 00:12:13,05
And many others you know for training and in many other aspects is not is not a commodity

117
00:12:13,05 --> 00:12:18,99
or a consumer product you know it's not something that you can have in your home obviously

118
00:12:19,42 --> 00:12:23,09
but body has been incredibly successful.

119
00:12:24,72 --> 00:12:30,06
Another industry that has quite a lot and is not very well known in the press is the mining industry

120
00:12:30,24 --> 00:12:44,45
or safety training underground mines are. The Sunni complex and have a lot of safety issues around the world.

121
00:13:08,26 --> 00:13:09,65
Those are the marine trainers.

122
00:13:14,78 --> 00:13:27,83
And I think that's the main contribution to this work because in the minds of many people for maybe ten fifteen years.

123
00:13:29,21 --> 00:13:37,06
Virtual reality was a particular platform and my world to say virtual reality is a concept

124
00:13:37,29 --> 00:13:45,62
and that concept can be realized in a variety of platforms and is not one platform is a solution.

125
00:13:45,99 --> 00:13:54,39
There are different problems. Depending on the program platform for similar problems. This place is a good platform.

126
00:13:55,51 --> 00:13:59,95
But some of the problems. You see it in the lab all the kind of platforms are.

127
00:14:00,14 --> 00:14:22,11
More appropriate question maybe four years ago when virtual reality was not popular.

128
00:14:23,19 --> 00:14:27,23
The answer would be different today virtual reality is very popular.

129
00:14:27,37 --> 00:14:31,53
Again it was very popular in the ninety's and then he went silent and it's popular again

130
00:14:32,17 --> 00:14:38,55
and I think the reason to do it is I guess.

131
00:14:40,42 --> 00:14:47,18
The students that come and study with me something related to virtual reality

132
00:14:47,18 --> 00:14:53,93
and in particular if they work with me because of my name recognition then they'll get a good job

133
00:14:54,23 --> 00:14:59,28
and they'll make a lot of money. So those kind of students to be honest with you. I don't wonder.

134
00:14:59,46 --> 00:15:01,12
So students in my lab

135
00:15:01,12 --> 00:15:10,88
and we have learned very quickly to spot students because they don't really care about their work in their minds they

136
00:15:10,88 --> 00:15:18,35
think oh I'm doing something that is trendy and and just because I'm doing it

137
00:15:18,35 --> 00:15:25,6
and just because I'm doing you know I'm just going to graduate and I'm just going to get this high paying job

138
00:15:25,6 --> 00:15:35,47
but from from experience about what they're doing they care about making money at the end.

139
00:15:36,82 --> 00:15:42,74
So we care about those when they come to us and they say can I work with you because I have this idea

140
00:15:42,74 --> 00:15:51,87
and I think with your guidance I could explore this idea. And so that's an example of a student.

141
00:15:51,91 --> 00:15:56,68
That would like to find us because that's how I was you know I was doing something nobody had done it before

142
00:15:56,68 --> 00:16:18,19
and I had a professor that for. Andris another decided to let me run with a you know what is right or a holiday.

143
00:16:18,35 --> 00:16:29,99
Oh OK Well then what i normally. Plenty of people is just a way to create worlds with a computer. Now for me.

144
00:16:30,00 --> 00:16:35,87
That is very little difference between virtual reality and augmented reality.

145
00:16:36,37 --> 00:16:38,48
There are two fields and

146
00:16:38,48 --> 00:16:45,17
when you talk to different professionals there will be people there will be very very adamant that is true completely

147
00:16:45,17 --> 00:16:51,21
different disciplines you know you do virtual reality you know nothing mental reality. And so on.

148
00:16:51,42 --> 00:16:53,75
There are some other groups are not part of those clothes

149
00:16:53,75 --> 00:16:59,85
but I've seen both of them have a lot of common base concepts.

150
00:17:00,42 --> 00:17:06,00
And the differences with virtual reality you create worlds that are entirely in the computer.

151
00:17:06,05 --> 00:17:11,71
They don't necessarily have any relationship to the real world

152
00:17:11,71 --> 00:17:17,72
or too little reality that you find yourself in that particular moment so you can be tiny tiny tiny tiny

153
00:17:17,72 --> 00:17:27,83
and explore the world at the atomic level or you can be huge and explore a universe level you can travel.

154
00:17:28,51 --> 00:17:33,97
Worlds that never system you can go back in time you can go into the future. So basically.

155
00:17:34,95 --> 00:17:41,24
Whatever your imagination conceives you can generate that inside the computer.

156
00:17:41,91 --> 00:17:59,91
And then put yourself inside out for a while and that's a very good question for many of the words that we do there.

157
00:18:01,55 --> 00:18:08,58
To the people that experience those words there is something that we study that is called The sense of presence.

158
00:18:08,82 --> 00:18:17,03
So how how much does virtual worlds make you in a sense forget that their virtual

159
00:18:17,34 --> 00:18:25,98
and your sanity became so involved so engaged on the world that that world becomes real so you forget what that you are

160
00:18:26,59 --> 00:18:34,29
inside a company or something like that and you're completely get. Mentally and almost physically transported to that.

161
00:18:35,19 --> 00:18:37,2
New Reality whatever it is you know.

162
00:18:38,19 --> 00:18:39,3
So so

163
00:18:39,67 --> 00:18:47,1
and that's what we want to do sometimes we really want to feel that those places are real whether you're there for five

164
00:18:47,1 --> 00:18:47,48
minutes

165
00:18:47,48 --> 00:18:56,46
or three hours that you disconnect yourselves from the real world sometimes are very disoriented because we make worlds

166
00:18:56,46 --> 00:19:02,06
that intentionally don't behave like with the laws of physics as the real world US

167
00:19:02,82 --> 00:19:11,18
and is very interesting sometimes to see people are just in worlds you know because the something like for example as

168
00:19:11,65 --> 00:19:17,29
you know you see in the you have as there is going to happen in sound if you're going downstairs

169
00:19:17,29 --> 00:19:18,64
and you don't even know what happened.

170
00:19:18,66 --> 00:19:24,79
So we we have some words like that that you saw in the the laws of physics don't work

171
00:19:24,79 --> 00:19:30,27
but people become very functional just like they always did that.

172
00:19:30,49 --> 00:19:34,57
It makes a lot of sense that you're going up the stairs and Sally you end up in the basement.

173
00:19:34,63 --> 00:19:37,82
You know you go up stairs to go to the basement is just normal you know.

174
00:19:37,95 --> 00:19:48,12
So it's to me you know these kinds of things are very exciting in of course sometimes on that particular moment on that

175
00:19:48,12 --> 00:19:51,72
particular time frame that you are in the space you might become very real.

176
00:19:51,77 --> 00:19:59,85
We have people that are afraid sometimes to move in the virtual space because we have our floor is also.

177
00:20:00,9 --> 00:20:04,66
So sometimes we might be Betty high up another edge of something

178
00:20:05,28 --> 00:20:11,73
or maybe one of the prices that we have right now has one of those rope

179
00:20:11,73 --> 00:20:18,18
and boards bridges that you have to cross between two very high mountains.

180
00:20:18,55 --> 00:20:25,00
And we have people that want to cross that bridge because they're afraid of heights me personally.

181
00:20:25,17 --> 00:20:33,14
No no it's for me as is sometimes because I've been doing this for so long.

182
00:20:33,21 --> 00:20:43,44
Sometimes it's hard for me to disconnect myself from the real reality so I know I know in a sense IS NOT REAL FAKE to

183
00:20:43,44 --> 00:20:51,95
some extent. No I can I walk on water and I feel like.

184
00:20:52,6 --> 00:20:54,01
I mean the visions Yes but

185
00:20:54,01 --> 00:21:02,56
but we do have a lot of people that think twice before they go through this through that again with my how about going

186
00:21:02,56 --> 00:21:03,85
to that doesn't have any rating.

187
00:21:04,02 --> 00:21:10,51
You know a lot of people will not do that a step to get out of the balcony which nothing is going to happen I mean

188
00:21:10,51 --> 00:21:18,88
they're just going to the ground but virtually they are not on time so we have people that even if we push them

189
00:21:18,88 --> 00:21:28,98
and they will be jammed they said give it a try. No no. So it's a becomes four it becomes very very real and people do.

190
00:21:30,79 --> 00:21:39,71
They have this is strange to out of confusion in their heads they know it's not real but they behave like this real.

191
00:21:39,87 --> 00:21:59,09
So it's a very interesting. While again like I told at the beginning.

192
00:22:00,24 --> 00:22:27,48
Problems through virtual reality one probably never saw in all the time is different types of training. Yes virtual.

193
00:22:29,76 --> 00:22:37,53
Yes And it's also it's also a way to sometimes communicate. Your understanding of the world to others.

194
00:22:37,67 --> 00:22:44,86
For example we have worked with patients that have brain damage that has changed the way they perceive the world

195
00:22:44,92 --> 00:22:53,53
and how they. How they function. You know for us is very easy to look at this table and we know immediately said table.

196
00:22:53,56 --> 00:22:53,93
You know.

197
00:22:54,42 --> 00:23:00,42
For people have some kind of brain damage through accidents or some disease or something and they look at the table

198
00:23:00,42 --> 00:23:03,45
and they cannot recognize that this is a table for example you know.

199
00:23:03,83 --> 00:23:10,67
So sometimes the behavior feels erratic but it's not erratic because they find themselves in situations that.

200
00:23:10,92 --> 00:23:16,25
Just something as simple as a table that the brain doesn't process.

201
00:23:16,79 --> 00:23:26,03
So we have worked with some patients a few years back through their verbal descriptions of how they perceive the world

202
00:23:26,03 --> 00:23:31,14
we try to recreate virtual environments that we could become that person

203
00:23:31,56 --> 00:23:39,54
and we could understand how that person perceives the world and why that person has a panic attack

204
00:23:40,18 --> 00:23:45,86
when there's a tree on the path because it does not recognize that you know so those consensus.

205
00:23:46,31 --> 00:23:53,54
Is Yeah you can help people to understand your reality in a sense in a way you know.

206
00:23:53,95 --> 00:24:01,00
And again you can also create and completely new reality that we don't know what these nominees. You might imagine.

207
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:05,17
And Bill then and make a spin and I have a good colleague.

208
00:24:06,17 --> 00:24:14,72
That he's sort of perspective is that virtual reality allows you to be not only somebody else but something else.

209
00:24:14,92 --> 00:24:20,87
So he always gives the example he always wanted to be a lobster. So you know.

210
00:24:21,24 --> 00:24:29,9
He's like one of his first virtual over twenty something years ago West to understand the world from the perspective of

211
00:24:29,9 --> 00:24:38,33
a lobster and you use virtual reality and become a lobster. You know so. That's not really my my work. It's more.

212
00:24:39,09 --> 00:24:43,19
From a practical perspective. How do we solve a problem.

213
00:24:43,48 --> 00:24:45,38
You know certainly you know

214
00:24:45,38 --> 00:24:53,7
when I feel the world like let's say you were some sort of bacteria bacteria sender stand there world

215
00:24:53,7 --> 00:25:00,22
and how do they spread themselves through another organism Well you can use virtual reality and become a bacteria.

216
00:25:00,83 --> 00:25:41,02
And live in the world of microorganisms and see how the world. When you try to. And I see in there is a little bit of.

217
00:25:43,04 --> 00:25:48,33
I would say every new science there is always positive part of the science brings to society.

218
00:25:48,39 --> 00:25:56,26
And some of the potential that can bring into society and certainly that is a concern that.

219
00:25:56,92 --> 00:25:59,73
We might create some realities that become much.

220
00:26:00,01 --> 00:26:04,51
More pleasant much more rewarding

221
00:26:04,63 --> 00:26:11,2
or satisfactory a real reality especially in the world that we live today many frustrations you know we all have a lot

222
00:26:11,2 --> 00:26:16,07
of frustrations in our daily life and then you can going to virtual reality and you can be

223
00:26:18,13 --> 00:26:25,93
but he was the person with a beautiful virtual yacht going to some beautiful virtual island that you now are not you

224
00:26:25,93 --> 00:26:30,34
are a small tiny basement apartment that you can barely paid rent you know.

225
00:26:30,71 --> 00:26:35,65
So there is certainly a concern and it's a growing concern that we might.

226
00:26:36,55 --> 00:26:40,53
In the long term in the long term future not not in the next maybe five years

227
00:26:40,53 --> 00:26:49,28
but really looking fine into the future that we might create this reality to some extent that is better than our real

228
00:26:49,28 --> 00:26:57,78
reality and we my all in start living more those outer net realities versus the real life or something.

229
00:26:58,18 --> 00:27:05,00
And how within one hundred and that at this moment we are I think so early on what we are doing that.

230
00:27:05,01 --> 00:27:07,05
I don't think none of us has a baby

231
00:27:07,05 --> 00:27:14,68
and I have to say understanding our picture of how all this is going to happen because right now with the technology

232
00:27:14,68 --> 00:27:24,72
that we have I am personally convinced that will never really happen because the technology is still with what the way

233
00:27:24,72 --> 00:27:36,77
we have it right now we have and we have and I don't think we have found the right solution at all.

234
00:27:36,9 --> 00:27:39,12
All the platforms that we have right now.

235
00:27:39,24 --> 00:27:44,54
And right now I'm talking about physical platforms you know that if I have met all the different projects all the

236
00:27:44,54 --> 00:27:51,62
different all these things that we have they are not like transparent.

237
00:27:51,91 --> 00:28:01,73
You know it takes a conscious effort to put them on you have to have. A specific. Technology computers.

238
00:28:02,42 --> 00:28:06,63
You know it's not comfortable it doesn't feed well on your head it crashes.

239
00:28:07,13 --> 00:28:13,85
You know all those kinds of things so so it is a good novelty. But I think that as we move forward.

240
00:28:13,88 --> 00:28:17,16
People will like all the novelties you know and in a couple of years.

241
00:28:17,17 --> 00:28:18,04
Everybody will come down

242
00:28:18,04 --> 00:28:26,49
and then everybody is going to have their virtual reality set at the bottom of the drawer where like has happened with

243
00:28:26,49 --> 00:28:34,01
some of the gaming technologies that you know the way. I again with the current platforms as we have them today.

244
00:28:34,05 --> 00:28:40,98
I think so because again there were some gaming platforms which I'm not going to mention that they were going to change.

245
00:28:41,18 --> 00:28:45,15
They were going to change the world a few years ago. And what happened.

246
00:28:45,18 --> 00:28:46,93
Yes it was a great innovation

247
00:28:46,93 --> 00:28:55,5
but who wants to spend three four five six hours playing a video game standing on your feet you know it was a radical

248
00:28:55,5 --> 00:29:16,53
platform. Yeah and that's what I say with the technology that I have today.

249
00:29:16,67 --> 00:29:24,25
Now but in the direction that we're going whatever might come down the line you know certain concerns

250
00:29:24,25 --> 00:29:31,62
and there are starting to be around the world. Movements related to Essex and the use of virtual reality.

251
00:29:31,63 --> 00:29:38,64
So there are some you know starting there is some here in the U.S.

252
00:29:38,64 --> 00:29:44,85
Some in Europe that are starting to appear there are some in Asia where at this moment are being more kind of like

253
00:29:44,85 --> 00:29:53,14
coffee shop conversations you know a small group but they are starting to a P.R. Because that is that is a concern.

254
00:29:53,63 --> 00:30:00,78
Now at the same time is a concern to say hey we should stop doing what we're doing or not. Do it anymore.

255
00:30:00,81 --> 00:30:05,6
I don't think so because the benefits are so much

256
00:30:05,65 --> 00:30:14,83
and some many levels that this is something that is more education you know like drugs you know everybody knows that

257
00:30:14,83 --> 00:30:20,00
drugs are bad but people are still taking drugs. That's their own responsibility to make that decision.

258
00:30:20,16 --> 00:30:24,55
So there's always something

259
00:30:24,55 --> 00:30:32,8
but on the other hand you know it's also good because we also have done some work related to a stress and depression.

260
00:30:33,77 --> 00:30:44,86
And again in this reality there for a short period of time. Again some person whatever is your fantasy. A famous.

261
00:30:45,88 --> 00:30:53,62
Famous explorer going somewhere you know a love story. You know whatever your fantasy.

262
00:30:54,38 --> 00:31:00,48
Just just ten fifteen minutes exposure to that type of reality.

263
00:31:01,25 --> 00:31:05,89
Significantly cress decreases stress levels and depressions.

264
00:31:06,39 --> 00:32:08,56
And that has been demonstrated by not only another you know I would have I would. Well we have thought today.

265
00:32:08,75 --> 00:32:16,41
I mean look at what people are doing in Facebook is a you in Facebook is not really you I mean you are the one doing

266
00:32:16,41 --> 00:32:22,51
the postings but you are in a sense you know maybe exaggerating some of your postings.

267
00:32:23,83 --> 00:32:28,02
Not necessarily lying but embellish the situation.

268
00:32:28,26 --> 00:32:35,92
So we are ready to some extent are using some technologies that are multiple personalities

269
00:32:35,92 --> 00:32:43,81
or multiple identities you know a lot of discussions on how people represent themselves in chat rooms and in Twitter

270
00:32:43,81 --> 00:32:46,17
and some other things and so I think.

271
00:32:47,69 --> 00:32:55,86
Of course with virtual reality is much more powerful because it's not just your post in a picture

272
00:32:55,86 --> 00:33:04,51
and say oh look big deal about this you know but it's actually live in that they are actually creating

273
00:33:04,51 --> 00:33:05,16
or something like that.

274
00:33:05,32 --> 00:33:28,22
So I don't know personally that something that doesn't worry me to march because again the benefits are really in many

275
00:33:28,22 --> 00:33:31,58
ways maybe happier and healthier because you know as we're getting older.

276
00:33:31,61 --> 00:33:34,93
For example you know we don't have as much energy as we used to have

277
00:33:34,93 --> 00:33:40,83
but by my one of my identities can be a very energetic woman that kind of still go

278
00:33:40,83 --> 00:33:45,22
and you know down some point shoes which I have been dancing over thirty years now.

279
00:33:45,24 --> 00:33:53,8
You know but you know I kind of still virtually maybe do that you know maybe your other just to go and swim.

280
00:33:54,02 --> 00:33:59,94
You know ten kilometers or something. You know how close a straight.

281
00:34:00,01 --> 00:34:04,96
Somewhere and you cannot do that right now but that virtual reality might have argued to do it you know.

282
00:34:05,3 --> 00:34:11,75
So I think it's. As.

283
00:34:13,87 --> 00:34:19,84
Well we're also going to have life is going to change too because again some of the things that virtual reality helps

284
00:34:20,15 --> 00:34:27,08
like any other again new technologies to I think their way we work is going to change so as we are all having more

285
00:34:28,7 --> 00:34:36,22
right now we're in a strange in my opinion transmission technology we are having a lot of technologies that make our

286
00:34:36,22 --> 00:34:45,42
jobs but at the same time do more work. You know like for example e-mail e-mail communications tremendously.

287
00:34:45,45 --> 00:34:48,71
But at the same time we're communicating in a lot more so.

288
00:34:48,95 --> 00:34:56,00
So we can never we're always busy trying to clear our email you know so we communicate so much.

289
00:34:56,00 --> 00:35:02,36
Now that it's keeping us again looking into the future and many of these things get resolved

290
00:35:02,36 --> 00:35:08,85
and that translates into us having all their time that we can use for more quality time of something else. I mean.

291
00:35:09,72 --> 00:35:18,87
So I think maybe in the future virtual reality is going to help us to do our normal everyday work life easier in some

292
00:35:18,87 --> 00:35:30,24
ways you know like with companies for example that in the last ten years timeframe from the concept of a product to the

293
00:35:30,24 --> 00:35:31,56
pro the been in the market.

294
00:35:31,77 --> 00:35:34,01
In between seven

295
00:35:34,01 --> 00:35:40,82
and nine years with the introduction of virtual reality the way in virtual test in virtual prototyping bringing

296
00:35:40,82 --> 00:35:48,35
customers on the virtual. There's cycle now has for about two years.

297
00:35:49,88 --> 00:35:57,64
So that that has released a lot of the people in the company a tremendous amount of work that they can use for

298
00:35:57,64 --> 00:35:59,83
something else you know so I don't know.

299
00:36:00,01 --> 00:36:01,32
Hard to imagine future

300
00:36:01,32 --> 00:36:15,23
but at the same time I think we could potentially be a more relaxed future because again it's a few minutes of escapin

301
00:36:15,83 --> 00:36:21,82
you know I love the ocean and we don't live by the ocean. We live in the ME that of Arkansas right now.

302
00:36:21,91 --> 00:36:25,34
You know so it would be great if I could spend thirty minutes every day

303
00:36:25,34 --> 00:36:33,9
and feeling the breeze you know that alone would just be happy for the rest of the afternoon.

304
00:36:34,05 --> 00:36:41,43
You know just kind of hear like a humane and spend six months in the ocean or something.

305
00:36:41,49 --> 00:36:58,36
You know I don't know I think well of course of course because well the same as when you do in life.

306
00:36:58,66 --> 00:37:12,71
I mean the reality is not a pass. If reality is an active reality in real life. You don't see. You.

307
00:37:12,96 --> 00:37:18,99
You have to do things you know you have to open a can of Coke. You have to turn on the lights.

308
00:37:19,12 --> 00:37:34,72
You have to look at the window. You have to do something. No no no. You mean be glad your physical. Needs.

309
00:37:35,17 --> 00:37:40,34
Yes you're my other no it will be.

310
00:37:40,44 --> 00:37:51,78
I don't think anybody has done any size and I'm assuming that you know or thirsty or wanted to go to the restroom

311
00:37:51,78 --> 00:37:59,48
or something that I would probably still in the virtual reality.

312
00:38:00,27 --> 00:38:05,56
We'll override some of our basic survival instincts or something like that

313
00:38:05,56 --> 00:38:11,08
and I will be surprised if that happens you know we talk about them

314
00:38:11,08 --> 00:38:20,8
but I don't think you can do a version of the space. You don't feel hungry or something like that. You know and.

315
00:38:33,12 --> 00:38:42,52
This is the I mean there are there are then there are others that actually develop virtual taste

316
00:38:42,64 --> 00:38:47,07
and Virtual the smells you know also potentially potentially you my.

317
00:38:48,28 --> 00:38:53,76
Be in the virtual environment and just have virtual taste of the food and actually not being anything

318
00:38:53,76 --> 00:38:59,78
but I still think that it is so more the basic survival instance The sooner

319
00:38:59,78 --> 00:39:07,18
or later stomach it's going to be like OK this virtual taste is delicious but my tummy still has not received.

320
00:39:21,24 --> 00:39:29,84
I think that we can fake a lot like I tell you we get people that they will not walk off a balcony in a virtual

321
00:39:29,84 --> 00:39:35,3
environment you know so that's. That's a survival instinct that the real time I don't naturally.

322
00:39:39,41 --> 00:39:48,86
So well again it depends on how reality is really on the virtual world you know because we can make you fall down

323
00:39:48,86 --> 00:39:58,07
and we can bank you know a motion platform or put you in some kind of device that actually makes you feel the fall

324
00:39:58,07 --> 00:40:04,49
and actually hurt yourself if you. When I got to that level. So in my lab we don't do that right now.

325
00:40:04,59 --> 00:40:04,91
You know

326
00:40:04,91 --> 00:40:15,85
but in previous locations that I was before we actually had robotic type of systems that were around your body.

327
00:40:16,52 --> 00:40:23,74
And as you were interact in the virtual space the robotics were giving you physical feedback of the world.

328
00:40:23,75 --> 00:40:31,32
You know so in those pretty nicely. Yeah yeah. So you could actually touch of our challenge at Anfield.

329
00:40:31,74 --> 00:40:38,05
Or you could grab something and feel the weight of that one child not you so again depending on how real is reality.

330
00:40:38,33 --> 00:40:42,28
You can actually make it happen but assuming again with the technology that we have today.

331
00:40:42,41 --> 00:40:50,1
You know there are some some instance that again we trigger with our necessarily intentionally do it

332
00:40:50,1 --> 00:40:54,1
when we build the worlds but we observe that when we have people.

333
00:40:54,42 --> 00:41:00,00
I were I want to spaces you know so sometimes we don't realize something and then

334
00:41:00,00 --> 00:41:07,11
when we have people in our virtual spaces we're not these things and when I was with think about that one.

335
00:41:07,23 --> 00:41:10,76
You know because like I said earlier there's a lot of things we don't now.

336
00:41:11,00 --> 00:41:22,61
Yet we don't understand yet what this technology really does to our head. You know this coarseness we're just.

337
00:41:23,72 --> 00:41:45,67
Because we try to explore the borders of science was what is the future. When you. Please. So.

338
00:41:46,52 --> 00:41:59,13
You can create a new identity for yourself. Because it makes reality.

339
00:42:07,34 --> 00:42:11,61
And they might become for for for you or for me or for other people.

340
00:42:12,25 --> 00:42:16,18
The reality that you prefer to be versus the reality you know and.

341
00:42:16,46 --> 00:42:19,07
And as you know that has been around in science fiction for a long time.

342
00:42:19,21 --> 00:42:23,2
You know I mean there are for example Asimov has a few novels where.

343
00:42:23,9 --> 00:42:33,28
It's a society in which humans don't want to have face to face contact anymore because they prefer the virtual contact

344
00:42:33,28 --> 00:42:39,28
you know is to them almost a physical contact. They don't want to do that anymore. You know.

345
00:42:39,31 --> 00:42:42,00
So certainly like I say earlier you know.

346
00:42:45,48 --> 00:42:54,88
Pessimistic extreme side of things you know maybe we cannot our way of thinking and nothing will happen.

347
00:42:55,59 --> 00:42:56,78
I am positive way.

348
00:42:57,05 --> 00:43:04,82
It's Yeah you know hey if you're if your virtual reality makes you a better person makes you enjoy your life better

349
00:43:04,82 --> 00:43:31,37
then Lieberman was what's the big deal about it. You know I don't know. Right. So.

350
00:43:43,15 --> 00:43:55,18
I think my personal opinion is probably yes because again this is an identity that you are creating a digitally in a

351
00:43:55,18 --> 00:43:59,84
computer. So you can decide how much. You let others do.

352
00:44:00,01 --> 00:44:05,86
Influence your identity versus you have full control of your identity again at a very simplistic level.

353
00:44:06,32 --> 00:44:12,35
You know look at people doing social media you know some of us share everything with the entire world

354
00:44:12,53 --> 00:44:21,19
and we let the world sort of in a sense influence how we appear to the world in our social media

355
00:44:21,22 --> 00:44:26,41
and some of us have a lot of restrictions where we have a very limited group of people like

356
00:44:26,41 --> 00:44:28,57
and influence our conversations and

357
00:44:28,92 --> 00:44:35,02
and in that way maybe we don't necessarily are inform of everything else that happens because we don't do a so that's a

358
00:44:35,02 --> 00:44:45,61
simplistic level but again it's is a digital reality. So you can define. In the future.

359
00:44:45,62 --> 00:44:52,96
You can say you know I want to be a virtual Harmeet. So my reality is mine and mine alone.

360
00:44:53,49 --> 00:45:01,54
And I just don't want anybody else to distort it or to some a stand.

361
00:45:01,57 --> 00:45:08,34
You know or you know hey I have a really cool reality and I want to share that with my friends

362
00:45:08,34 --> 00:45:09,68
or with the rest of the world.

363
00:45:09,69 --> 00:45:18,08
You know and let us see how these but this goes you know because I let other people evolve it with me

364
00:45:18,08 --> 00:45:22,97
and see where the so I think everything at this moment is an open.

365
00:45:23,68 --> 00:45:35,76
Possibility again mediated by the again thinking as an engineer mediated by how we build the tools and the systems

366
00:45:35,76 --> 00:45:41,21
and the platforms and all those kinds of things to make these things happen because today is not possible.

367
00:45:41,48 --> 00:45:50,75
And normal person is not at the level of technology that we have

368
00:45:50,75 --> 00:45:54,23
and other people around the world as you know they cannot do that right now.

369
00:45:54,44 --> 00:45:59,91
You know it's not it's not very easy to create these realities right.

370
00:46:00,13 --> 00:46:08,83
You have to have a certain training to be able to do it you know. In a body for the future. Yes.

371
00:46:16,25 --> 00:46:21,82
Yeah well if I can the rest for a moment I'm going to talk about a little bit where you are mentioning right now

372
00:46:21,82 --> 00:46:31,25
because that's something that right now is a baby concern of mine a personal concern that I have which is the many

373
00:46:31,25 --> 00:46:38,52
people today are virtual reality developer experts.

374
00:46:38,76 --> 00:46:49,27
You know because everybody today has a computer because gaming industry has very very clearly everybody has a fairly

375
00:46:49,27 --> 00:46:59,02
good computer at home that can do pretty good graphics pretty good and he mentions on those kinds of things you know.

376
00:46:59,64 --> 00:47:03,77
So there are some tools out there are our open source

377
00:47:03,77 --> 00:47:09,55
or free license tools that people can get their hands on the B.B.C.

378
00:47:09,55 --> 00:47:19,21
and Now suddenly were seen all these virtual reality experts popping up everywhere because they seen that because they

379
00:47:19,21 --> 00:47:27,33
grab the tool they do a few pretty three D. Models and they put it on Google carb or for example you know.

380
00:47:27,45 --> 00:47:37,07
Oh I'm very close to reality. While I this is something that is have a frustration of mine because this is not.

381
00:47:38,17 --> 00:47:43,49
There's many other things behind that because I mean you guys are producing a documentary.

382
00:47:43,6 --> 00:47:47,26
So you know everybody nowadays can get a digital camera.

383
00:47:48,07 --> 00:47:52,22
But I'm going to produce a documentary of the level of quality that you're going to do

384
00:47:52,22 --> 00:47:59,89
and know because you know I the fact that I can get to come. I should have somebody face on hold. That is that.

385
00:48:00,01 --> 00:48:02,49
Doesn't mean that doesn't make me a good director.

386
00:48:02,53 --> 00:48:06,78
You know because that is all that lights that is the question is that you're making me and

387
00:48:06,83 --> 00:48:08,35
and this business that we all have.

388
00:48:09,23 --> 00:48:12,01
The same thing happens in virtual reality and you can get a tool

389
00:48:12,41 --> 00:48:22,00
but do you know what your parameters are you know they're. Oh absolutely.

390
00:48:22,22 --> 00:48:31,07
I mean for example if you're generating a world there is a certain speed which the world needs to be presented to the

391
00:48:31,07 --> 00:48:33,76
user or there was a user plain and simple.

392
00:48:33,83 --> 00:48:36,36
He's going to get really really really sick right of the

393
00:48:36,36 --> 00:48:44,75
but now many many people don't understand that they just start putting three D. Worlds in the three D.

394
00:48:44,75 --> 00:48:50,92
Models and they have a horrible performance. That are not even synchronized one eye is going this way or the other.

395
00:48:52,51 --> 00:48:53,19
You know

396
00:48:53,19 --> 00:49:00,6
and my issue is that the US does kinds of applications sometimes aren't the first virtual reality perience for many

397
00:49:00,6 --> 00:49:03,55
people and we are starting to see more

398
00:49:03,55 --> 00:49:10,74
and more people coming in our laboratory saying oh no I don't want to try a thing here.

399
00:49:10,77 --> 00:49:16,45
I already tried to react and it made me very very sick. You know. So there's this immediate rejection.

400
00:49:16,73 --> 00:49:23,5
And I'm like well you know I'm not a high school that just got my hands on free license something and a slap together.

401
00:49:24,26 --> 00:49:27,22
A pretty model. You know we have been doing this.

402
00:49:27,31 --> 00:49:35,6
Betty scientifically very consciously with all the right approach and constraints and years

403
00:49:35,6 --> 00:49:42,91
and years of experience of place try not to. And that is unfortunate. I happened in my own on my own more.

404
00:49:43,26 --> 00:49:50,39
And now these are things that we've been talking about will now happen if this other thing continues proliferate

405
00:49:50,39 --> 00:49:55,73
because if this period see the people are negative experiences there's going to be rejection

406
00:49:55,73 --> 00:49:58,1
and that happened back in the ninety's.

407
00:50:01,46 --> 00:50:08,86
Yes So I was mentioned to you and I do talk a lot around the world about what I do

408
00:50:08,86 --> 00:50:14,16
and also my virtual reality is going to go

409
00:50:14,16 --> 00:50:22,5
and I am pretty convinced that we're living in one of those human history changing times right now.

410
00:50:22,95 --> 00:50:27,00
We don't see it because we're living generations into the future.

411
00:50:27,28 --> 00:50:35,38
You know maybe two hundred years from now three hundred years from now people of my time a virtual reality revolution

412
00:50:35,38 --> 00:50:37,02
the industrial revolution

413
00:50:37,02 --> 00:50:47,18
and the information revolution I think we have a point I think it's going to change our world as we know are going to

414
00:50:47,18 --> 00:50:53,32
change how we leave us humans and how humans.

415
00:50:53,92 --> 00:50:55,98
And of course we don't know it because we're living in right now

416
00:50:55,98 --> 00:51:01,04
but I again I'm pretty convinced in a few hundred years or no.

417
00:51:01,07 --> 00:51:02,23
We'll be on the textbooks

418
00:51:02,23 --> 00:51:11,05
and say you know the twenty fifteen to twenty twenty is was the peak of the virtual reality revolution were all this

419
00:51:11,05 --> 00:51:20,54
was happening you know. It's hard to imagine how the future is going to look like but I think I think you're right.

420
00:51:20,64 --> 00:51:29,26
Try and there we are I think. I'm doing a lot of things.

421
00:51:29,35 --> 00:51:37,39
I mean right now the things that I cannot do because of physical limitations.

422
00:51:37,53 --> 00:51:46,96
What I might be doing well you know I would be right now and saying you know is super hot at this particular moment

423
00:51:46,96 --> 00:51:55,06
and I really want to reach in five seconds. You know and. I'm going to go. I'm going to go in the beach.

424
00:51:55,14 --> 00:51:59,54
I'm going to the ocean. I'm going to smell the beautiful salty.

425
00:52:00,91 --> 00:52:07,42
And I'm going to forget about all these forgiveness and humidity of July in Arkansas for whatever time I'm in there.

426
00:52:09,13 --> 00:52:17,45
My child my decide that he wants to go to some amusement park but I don't have the time to physically take him there.

427
00:52:17,58 --> 00:52:21,61
Or maybe. We don't have the finances to go.

428
00:52:21,61 --> 00:52:30,55
They are my son my say OK Mommy I'm just going to go par for the next two hours or the mother me. You know.

429
00:52:30,83 --> 00:52:38,89
So I think that was that's an example or my car just broke down and I have no idea how to fix this car you know

430
00:52:38,89 --> 00:52:45,55
but I'm just going to go into some reality that is just going to somehow how me fix that car and get a better.

431
00:52:45,65 --> 00:52:46,08
You know

432
00:52:46,08 --> 00:52:52,39
or since I cannot go with my real car then I'm going to go into some virtual reality what I'm going to go what I was

433
00:52:52,39 --> 00:52:56,13
going to go up and I cannot go you know so I think that is going to be.

434
00:52:57,13 --> 00:53:04,01
You know I tend to tell them to tell people that we can do with virtual reality

435
00:53:04,01 --> 00:53:05,36
and we're limited to what emerging nations

436
00:53:05,36 --> 00:53:09,79
and I think right now what imagination is still very constrained by real life.

437
00:53:10,42 --> 00:53:15,64
So it's very hard to imagine a world that is not physically constrained.

438
00:53:15,82 --> 00:53:16,24
You know

439
00:53:16,24 --> 00:53:27,3
and be in my generation in my be the next generation after us that actually has a much more free mind to imagine

440
00:53:27,3 --> 00:53:33,39
because I see in right now our own developing the technology that we have now freed up our minds

441
00:53:33,39 --> 00:53:39,83
but the steam really can do. Again the ability to go or whatever that they are.

442
00:53:39,83 --> 00:53:48,53
It just opens again at a time in human history that that is completely different from everything else that we have

443
00:53:48,53 --> 00:53:55,86
right now and you know here I am I've been doing this since I was a youngest you then

444
00:53:55,86 --> 00:53:59,82
and people say hey don't you get bored and I know because you know a.

445
00:54:00,04 --> 00:54:06,12
The difference for example with let's say maybe a biology is that he spends his

446
00:54:06,12 --> 00:54:10,92
or her entire career looking for a particular drug to cure at the C.S.

447
00:54:11,52 --> 00:54:21,65
You know I haven't spent my entire life in one hundred S. So sense of different reality is a spirit and says worlds.

448
00:54:21,84 --> 00:54:26,00
I've seen things that I've never seen before. I've been in places that I cannot be otherwise.

449
00:54:26,24 --> 00:54:29,03
You know I've been in fifteenth century India for example

450
00:54:29,03 --> 00:54:34,33
and I have participated in some religious ritual that doesn't happen anymore.

451
00:54:34,61 --> 00:54:37,67
In real life you know we have been into the future

452
00:54:37,67 --> 00:54:44,28
and trying to figure out how life in Mars is going to be you know I have traveled through galaxies.

453
00:54:44,56 --> 00:54:49,68
I had gone down inside a plant cell and I actually traveled inside a water molecule

454
00:54:49,68 --> 00:54:52,27
and see for the synthesis from the you know.

455
00:54:52,31 --> 00:55:03,78
No I don't because I believe many many life whirls on the system in a way and I were there to see.

456
00:55:04,42 --> 00:55:10,16
But I cannot physically this business that you know so to me is really exciting you know

457
00:55:10,16 --> 00:55:15,62
and like I say what are we going to do one hundred years from now two hundred years from now.

458
00:55:15,86 --> 00:55:19,61
I don't know I mean it's hard to imagine because again.

459
00:55:19,71 --> 00:55:26,59
Could you imagine writing a water molecule and follow the water molecule inside a plant so you can imagine that.

460
00:55:26,63 --> 00:55:31,11
Well we've done it you know and we've done that with team in our lab for example you know.

461
00:55:31,75 --> 00:55:43,63
So it's sometimes it feels like I haven't broken my IRA chains here yet. You know we're trying.

462
00:56:02,32 --> 00:56:07,22
Yeah and to me that's what is exciting to see the little ones you know.

463
00:56:08,35 --> 00:56:18,12
We have a six year old son and to me sometimes watching him. In virtual reality. My own mind.

464
00:56:18,32 --> 00:56:26,8
Sometimes you know because his mind is not constrained as my mind because we have right now.

465
00:56:26,92 --> 00:56:33,5
I think we have four generations concurrently living as a see relates not only to virtual reality

466
00:56:33,5 --> 00:56:34,74
but to technology in general

467
00:56:34,74 --> 00:56:40,45
and again it's a unique time in history because you know all the issues related to health

468
00:56:40,45 --> 00:56:44,16
and quality of life have been are the best in human history.

469
00:56:44,53 --> 00:56:47,48
So now we have people that are living well into their eighty's

470
00:56:47,48 --> 00:56:56,73
and ninety's having a perfectly functional life so we have elderly people that have been their entire life with our

471
00:56:56,73 --> 00:57:01,6
technology and now in their sixty's seventy's eighty's are facing technology.

472
00:57:01,75 --> 00:57:09,63
So when you put those people in the right your reality. Is my best way to describe it is just adorable.

473
00:57:09,88 --> 00:57:11,21
It's just adorable.

474
00:57:12,6 --> 00:57:17,04
They just like to see and they're like oh

475
00:57:17,04 --> 00:57:25,96
and they just they just don't they cannot even comprehend what it is that they're looking at you know.

476
00:57:26,42 --> 00:57:32,07
They're very afraid of movie. They just kind of look around and they're like thank you. D.R.

477
00:57:32,07 --> 00:57:39,83
but That you know people like us you know the next sort of group of people were technology came

478
00:57:39,83 --> 00:57:42,91
when we were ready professionals very young professionals.

479
00:57:43,39 --> 00:57:48,18
So we have to develop our professional life with this technology around us.

480
00:57:48,33 --> 00:57:54,67
So I think we are the Tinkers because we are the ones that are like. How this thing works.

481
00:57:54,83 --> 00:57:59,12
You know what can I do with this thing you know so. So for us.

482
00:58:00,04 --> 00:58:10,56
The mystery is not so much on more of the the vision of what this thing is going to do for the life of the humans for

483
00:58:10,56 --> 00:58:14,72
as the mystery is was under the hood and how this thing works.

484
00:58:14,84 --> 00:58:15,19
You know

485
00:58:15,54 --> 00:58:21,68
and that's really what my generation is really focused on then there's the next generation which is the people that are

486
00:58:21,68 --> 00:58:29,59
now maybe in their twenty's or so you know and this technology came to them when they were kids

487
00:58:29,62 --> 00:58:34,58
but all their kids like teenagers are so so for them it was kind of like.

488
00:58:36,42 --> 00:58:42,33
I have it whatever you know I'm texting I'm doing this and doing that is cool. I can play video games.

489
00:58:43,53 --> 00:58:52,34
So for them is is something that is a cool factor and then you had little ones that are being born into these

490
00:58:52,34 --> 00:58:59,91
and like my son my son because his you know we have research as he's literally been in virtual reality since he was

491
00:58:59,91 --> 00:59:05,04
even I mean I have pictures on him in the little basket as a newborn inside a cave and things like you know.

492
00:59:05,49 --> 00:59:16,06
So so for him is just it's just like a refrigerator is just so so he doesn't wonder about it.

493
00:59:17,11 --> 00:59:27,88
He's not afraid of he's not curious about how it works where he's curious. What happens in here.

494
00:59:28,71 --> 00:59:34,47
You know he's he's perspective this you know he goes into overtime environment

495
00:59:34,71 --> 00:59:36,58
and he just wants to just seems in there.

496
00:59:37,18 --> 00:59:45,46
He doesn't think about how difficult or how comfortable you know he is immediately mentally

497
00:59:47,19 --> 00:59:48,54
and he just wants to be there

498
00:59:49,24 --> 00:59:55,47
and then hysteroscopy a lot of interesting questions because he wants to do things that he cannot do and for him.

499
00:59:55,48 --> 00:59:59,64
That doesn't have any logic. Because again he's mentally they are.

500
01:00:00,54 --> 01:00:07,48
So he has in his mind he has a concept of how to stay in nice to respond to him

501
01:00:07,51 --> 01:00:09,87
and he's not responding to him sometimes because for straight.

502
01:00:13,52 --> 01:00:19,34
Because because he's my niece is is way beyond my mind you know so but he so.

503
01:00:19,37 --> 01:00:24,08
So when when he sees my constraints implemented on the system.

504
01:00:24,86 --> 01:00:28,5
He gets frustrated because he wants to really go a day or

505
01:00:28,5 --> 01:00:33,73
but he said there that I don't understand it you know because I'm still busy looking under the hood.

506
01:00:33,9 --> 01:00:41,99
You know so I think for me in our case we're very fortunate because she is the whole family.

507
01:00:43,23 --> 01:00:47,26
My husband is part of the the same research that I do you know

508
01:00:47,26 --> 01:00:55,57
when our son pretty much leaves with us in the in the lab whenever he's not schooled you know so we have an interesting

509
01:00:55,57 --> 01:00:57,28
perspective on doing this

510
01:00:57,28 --> 01:01:05,18
and in some cases like I say he our little son sometimes opens our minds just because we see his frustrations because

511
01:01:05,18 --> 01:01:09,44
he suspects some things that are not happening.

512
01:01:10,23 --> 01:01:15,03
But we didn't even think about it because we were to be very you know saw.

513
01:01:15,37 --> 01:01:22,66
So this is a she's getting a little older I think it's going to be if he continues being interesting because you know

514
01:01:23,08 --> 01:01:26,44
who knows where Bella been as he grows up.

515
01:01:26,62 --> 01:01:35,02
I think is going to be interesting to see he's on restricted mine and I you mentioned earlier you know.

516
01:01:35,33 --> 01:01:39,99
He might develop different identities that I'm not thinking about you know

517
01:01:40,52 --> 01:01:48,14
but he might decide that you know we just got some face and equipment in our laboratory and he mastered that equipment.

518
01:01:48,79 --> 01:01:59,54
Before any of our students and watching him you seen that particular if we met he was absolutely amazing. The students.

519
01:02:00,01 --> 01:02:08,9
Got the technology to look around. And couldn't see anything to do with it.

520
01:02:10,48 --> 01:02:21,11
He could spend hours days doing things with it. And I we were to do that you know. Is amazing.

521
01:02:21,2 --> 01:02:22,38
It's just amazing to see that.

522
01:02:22,4 --> 01:02:24,53
So I think we have those those different generations

523
01:02:24,53 --> 01:02:30,71
and it's very very interesting you know because again I have my older parents too

524
01:02:30,71 --> 01:02:33,91
and watching them sometimes their reaction is the total opposite.

525
01:02:34,34 --> 01:02:41,03
You know the market strain because they they don't even want to move because they feel they're going to break something

526
01:02:41,03 --> 01:02:48,81
or or they're not sure what to spend you know later once they're somewhere else that we don't even know.

527
01:02:48,92 --> 01:03:03,85
So that's amazing. And he's playing he travels with us.

528
01:03:03,88 --> 01:03:08,84
Sometimes when we do professional events and he actually is in the both know in their minds

529
01:03:08,84 --> 01:03:20,92
and is really really fun watching him explaining this interpretation of our work is just really amazing because in most

530
01:03:20,92 --> 01:03:31,42
cases. He just observes a little bit. But he just takes it to a completely different level immediately not to me.

531
01:03:31,43 --> 01:03:36,14
I mean he doesn't even know how to read but it's just again he's he's my me someone else.

532
01:03:36,2 --> 01:03:47,33
I cannot go there and to constrain. With my own knowledge of the technology to let me go there where he doesn't.

533
01:03:50,24 --> 01:03:57,83
What you mean by.

534
01:04:02,83 --> 01:04:14,53
OH NO HE No no no he doesn't need no he just you know he's not only he I mean we talk about my son because of

535
01:04:16,11 --> 01:04:20,91
when he brings his little friends to the lab sometimes you know it's the same thing.

536
01:04:21,14 --> 01:04:25,96
I mean you know they're a little kindergarten. You know and they.

537
01:04:27,44 --> 01:04:37,32
They again they start doing manipulating the space creating you know their own world.

538
01:04:39,59 --> 01:04:44,92
With a freedom that we don't have you know and they don't know how to read or write

539
01:04:47,47 --> 01:04:55,97
but is not about that understanding of the world or something. You know they grew up with.

540
01:04:56,01 --> 01:05:03,87
So for them is just as normal in the house.

541
01:05:09,48 --> 01:05:20,1
It certainly will be the mind of the universe for the future of course because I mean every every generation needs a

542
01:05:20,1 --> 01:05:26,28
new mindset on not only technology just humanity

543
01:05:26,28 --> 01:05:33,02
and the world you know I mean these are the new minds of the New Universe because the new universe is not going to be

544
01:05:33,02 --> 01:05:39,01
only the universe as we know it today with the planets and the galaxies and all the beautiful formations.

545
01:05:39,69 --> 01:05:52,26
Is a completely leave made less universe because it's going to come out of power so it's new mines Absolutely. What.

546
01:06:00,44 --> 01:06:11,27
Yes that's what I said the New Universe is it doesn't have physical constraints because again we can create it in the

547
01:06:11,27 --> 01:06:21,63
computer there the real universe is still will be there and all the re our program sniper global warning crime.

548
01:06:21,85 --> 01:06:22,58
Social the start.

549
01:06:22,61 --> 01:06:29,96
Those of course those are going to be there and that's outside my expertise to to prepare their word for it

550
01:06:29,96 --> 01:06:41,69
but we might get to the point of saying we will get to the point not of my generation

551
01:06:41,69 --> 01:06:49,38
but I won't get into the point because again we go back to what I was Who are we are not the difference between real

552
01:06:49,38 --> 01:06:55,23
and virtual because we go back to my earlier common people don't differentiate between virtual reality

553
01:06:55,23 --> 01:07:00,61
and augmented reality and I don't I seen this in a sense the same.

554
01:07:01,01 --> 01:07:08,6
Because the virtual reality in the computer with cemented reality you come blend it into the real world.

555
01:07:09,99 --> 01:07:15,47
So so that's really for me where the future were virtual reality

556
01:07:15,47 --> 01:07:22,89
and I meant of reality converge because now your real reality and your virtual reality are intermingled

557
01:07:22,89 --> 01:07:28,49
and not different from each other so.

558
01:07:28,53 --> 01:07:33,66
So again we can be looking out that we know and I know I'm looking at the river

559
01:07:33,66 --> 01:07:46,74
but mental reality I'm I see I don't know some mystical dragon flying by in the head of the birds is my reality because

560
01:07:46,74 --> 01:07:51,86
I want to see dragons flying or running through my window. So I still see the river.

561
01:07:51,91 --> 01:07:56,58
I see the same things you see I see that real trees I see the barges coming down the river

562
01:07:56,58 --> 01:07:59,23
but I have my dragons flying around. That's my reality.

563
01:08:31,43 --> 01:09:08,47
No I think in the definition of again and again we have one makes me me me based whatever I want to be me. You know me.

564
01:09:09,45 --> 01:09:43,91
You know the essence you know because again you can be different things you can be in different places. Again.

565
01:09:49,44 --> 01:09:59,83
Personalities or something like that. You know but that is. You know might be a dominant personality. You know.

566
01:10:00,3 --> 01:10:04,07
I think perhaps that way to look at it is we might have a choice.

567
01:10:04,26 --> 01:10:09,09
I mean right now we don't have a choice me is me is this month whether I like it or not this is.

568
01:10:10,16 --> 01:10:27,48
You this is the one choice. Something like. I was in the end they were saying Richard things.

569
01:10:27,61 --> 01:10:49,96
I thin in my yes maybe he was. Yeah but I can't say for us.

570
01:10:50,19 --> 01:11:01,88
I'm going to be that person that that individual that maybe I don't know

571
01:11:01,88 --> 01:11:10,11
when my hand there have been some supreme individual that is our main character that we decide this is this is the boss

572
01:11:10,11 --> 01:11:17,23
of all my individual's representations and this is the one amazing all the decisions. I don't know like I said to me.

573
01:11:17,88 --> 01:11:21,59
It's hard to envision that this moment because there are.

574
01:11:22,21 --> 01:11:32,47
Again I feel I'm a little bit constraint on what I know I can do for us.

575
01:11:32,51 --> 01:11:33,94
Yeah

576
01:11:33,94 --> 01:11:40,92
but again I thought back to what we have today with the situations with social media you know that there are there are

577
01:11:40,92 --> 01:11:49,55
many that are potentially many myths out there you know because many of us maybe we have one social media persona

578
01:11:49,55 --> 01:11:52,61
appetite are people that have multiple social media personas.

579
01:11:52,68 --> 01:12:02,13
You know and you know I might be talking to you on my social media person now when I'm some young teenager. Go surfing.

580
01:12:02,34 --> 01:12:08,21
You know and you have no way to know you're talking with a fifty something year old woman you know

581
01:12:08,87 --> 01:12:16,88
but behind all those personas. I'm still me making been the supreme me making the decision not to have this.

582
01:12:26,49 --> 01:12:29,75
Kind of the finest of for herself.

583
01:12:43,75 --> 01:12:45,57
Now I know what you mean

584
01:12:45,57 --> 01:12:51,52
but I think you can trust your identities because you are building those identities The problem is with the other

585
01:12:51,52 --> 01:12:53,19
people can't trust your identities.

586
01:12:54,61 --> 01:12:59,67
You are building those identities so I don't see any issues and you are me trust in my own

587
01:12:59,67 --> 01:13:03,95
and it is because I'm defining those I'm building those and making those happening.

588
01:13:04,37 --> 01:13:10,75
So I don't see now have an issue as you know I can I can be a lobster and I totally trust myself as a lobster.

589
01:13:11,11 --> 01:13:17,98
Now you know would you trust me as a lobster I would question you now.

590
01:13:18,2 --> 01:13:25,4
So this more and again going back to the simpler situation with social media is the same thing.

591
01:13:25,75 --> 01:13:29,91
Do you trust that person through social media.

592
01:13:30,17 --> 01:13:39,03
Don't you really don't know who that person is you see what the postings are what the blocks are what they may be fake

593
01:13:39,03 --> 01:13:44,86
pictures that person is not that person is trusting himself or herself because they are building that

594
01:13:44,86 --> 01:14:03,14
but the problem is not so much than the others. And yes there is again that is. We may reach a point where we don't.

595
01:14:03,14 --> 01:14:09,31
And again science fiction has already discussed this heavily in a lot of different books you know where where you get

596
01:14:09,31 --> 01:14:15,87
into the Saturn is reality universes and you get to a point where you don't know which one is the real one anymore

597
01:14:15,87 --> 01:14:22,06
and which one is a dream and which one is. And potentially we can get into that direction.

598
01:14:22,48 --> 01:14:29,22
Again not in the very short term but in a very long term potentially we can go that way.

599
01:14:29,54 --> 01:14:40,03
We would probably neither you or me would be alive by then time but there is there is now.

600
01:14:40,18 --> 01:14:47,18
Yes Then maybe we can create some of that is Stace even though we are physically no longer here

601
01:14:47,18 --> 01:14:48,23
and there is a possibility.

602
01:14:48,77 --> 01:15:01,52
Does that really I'm saying we're going to be in more time in virtual reality maybe we are you know robotics people are

603
01:15:01,52 --> 01:15:08,56
starting to the you can transfer your mind to the Robert our physical body might be gone

604
01:15:08,56 --> 01:15:10,09
but maybe many years from now

605
01:15:10,09 --> 01:15:22,35
when my continually we known ourselves who now you know all these things are out they are for our imaginations to

606
01:15:22,35 --> 01:15:36,8
really explode I guess there's going to be a lot more people out there. Again for us for me.

607
01:15:36,91 --> 01:15:50,1
You know our life or way of living that I have no choice

608
01:15:50,1 --> 01:15:56,56
and some people choose their past mine with no choice in Mass was totally random I came from here and I'm from there

609
01:15:56,56 --> 01:15:59,73
and I'm from there and I landed into these virtual reality thing without.

610
01:16:00,01 --> 01:16:04,99
And knowing when I landed and you know I just enjoy it tremendously

611
01:16:04,99 --> 01:16:14,51
but it was not up plan like I had some students that come with a Betty plan but it just happened.

612
01:16:14,53 --> 01:16:20,58
You know and it's been it's been fun and and it's fun to be able to open the door

613
01:16:20,58 --> 01:16:31,58
and see what happens to the next the next generations that don't have those constraints where they're really come fly

614
01:16:31,58 --> 01:16:39,01
free and and that's and that is when real progress is going to happen right now we're just starting

615
01:16:39,01 --> 01:16:47,84
and we are again sometimes constrained from our want to own our own knowledge today constrain sometimes

616
01:16:47,84 --> 01:16:55,54
and we can think and the new generations that now that she's a matter of fact is not a discovery anymore.

617
01:16:55,96 --> 01:17:00,28
Then they can take it to the next level some as we did from the previous generations from us.

618
01:17:00,41 --> 01:17:12,17
But he patted the practicality. I guess I lost of his very much.

619
01:17:12,33 --> 01:17:45,74
But I think that fundamentally what makes virtual reality to me an exciting science.

620
01:17:46,18 --> 01:17:50,99
Is that there are no rules limiting what we can do.

621
01:17:51,13 --> 01:17:57,15
Again we will go back to the example of our biology so something like that is trying to find a cure for the cease.

622
01:17:57,52 --> 01:18:07,66
She's or her career. T.V. Is bound by the laws of physics. No matter how many ideas they can have a D.N.A.

623
01:18:07,66 --> 01:18:17,41
Of the day it has to have some sort of molecular Bondy in protein something in vitals whatever D.N.A.

624
01:18:17,41 --> 01:18:20,66
Something it has very clear rules of behavior.

625
01:18:21,34 --> 01:18:28,85
The nice thing about virtual reality is we don't have that like I say early dilema is what we can imagine

626
01:18:29,64 --> 01:18:34,46
but we can think we have no physical constraints the physical world.

627
01:18:35,07 --> 01:18:49,24
Does not constrain what we can do in the virtual reality is magic because again I am not bound by the laws of physics.

628
01:18:49,99 --> 01:18:57,4
So I What is magic because here if I want to walk on the ceiling.

629
01:18:57,43 --> 01:19:05,14
I can't because gravity is going to make me fall in virtual reality the nothing prevents me from starting walking out

630
01:19:05,14 --> 01:19:14,07
the wall and walking up the ceiling. It might be a matter of fact you know it's magic.

631
01:19:14,1 --> 01:19:25,32
Because for example I'm here with you right now and in two seconds. I can be in China does my cheek. You know like.

632
01:19:27,62 --> 01:19:35,66
I don't know you can ask my father but I think they're starting more and more when when I started doing this.

633
01:19:36,00 --> 01:19:41,48
Many many years ago they were very worried

634
01:19:41,48 --> 01:19:45,46
and skeptical that I was doing something that was worth anything because of course

635
01:19:45,46 --> 01:19:54,39
when I started it was that the really tinkering times hours that are covered from head to toe in myself in a scuffle

636
01:19:54,39 --> 01:20:01,37
the screwdrivers on my hands all the time you know so but I think over to you. They've seen a lot of.

637
01:20:04,57 --> 01:20:15,02
They've seen how the world has been spread out in a lot of industry in a lot of different parts of society

638
01:20:15,02 --> 01:20:24,59
and I think understanding better. Again the. Their perspective.

639
01:20:25,2 --> 01:20:32,61
Like for them is truly much like I have no idea how you do these funny but it looks great.

640
01:20:33,9 --> 01:20:42,56
So for them is truly truly magic. You know for me again this is magic in the sense that you can just in a split second.

641
01:20:44,00 --> 01:20:53,81
Be somewhere else and again that's somewhat. A reconstruction of a real place or a completely imagination place and.

642
01:20:54,04 --> 01:21:03,49
And you can see sometimes again on the on the little ones you can. You can hear my sound something like this is magic.

643
01:21:03,66 --> 01:21:04,87
I'm doing magic.

644
01:21:05,41 --> 01:21:13,4
You know because he does something about our hands or something and something else happens and of course in real life.

645
01:21:13,99 --> 01:21:23,68
It's impossible to do. It is magic and his magic out because it just chance people you know people.

646
01:21:24,96 --> 01:21:26,46
You know when you go to Disney World.

647
01:21:27,07 --> 01:21:32,24
It's just magical place when people go to virtual reality it's the same feeling

648
01:21:34,27 --> 01:22:15,75
and Changmin like oh this is really nice is fine. Almighty being.

649
01:22:17,24 --> 01:22:27,26
Maybe I'm not I don't know but you know I mean it's what everybody in the valley can believe you know

650
01:22:27,26 --> 01:22:37,11
when like I say I don't I don't believe that if I step out of my virtual bank on the I'm going to fall down the cliff

651
01:22:37,11 --> 01:22:42,41
you know and there are many people at home and they cannot take that a step. You know.

652
01:23:04,75 --> 01:23:14,02
And I think I send a skeptical about that because you know it's in the computer.

653
01:23:21,22 --> 01:23:23,07
Yeah I think I think for something like.

654
01:23:24,58 --> 01:23:31,15
For something that they are talking I SAME MY have to be you know if you look in the history you know every time

655
01:23:31,15 --> 01:23:32,88
there's a new religion or a new goal

656
01:23:32,88 --> 01:23:38,54
or something something very drastic happened in human history that is new god appears you know so.

657
01:23:38,97 --> 01:23:49,51
So might be a possibility for again some massive drastic who knows what happens in human history that Sanny the world

658
01:23:49,51 --> 01:23:59,61
supersedes the physical world in some on that.

659
01:23:52,26 --> 01:24:00,6
and then adopt point maybe there should be maybe some new groups of people that I start creating D.S. You know.

660
01:24:01,86 --> 01:24:07,49
Almighty being that he's never seen or something but I seen with the world as we know it today.

661
01:24:08,52 --> 01:24:09,93
I don't see that happening.

662
01:24:10,04 --> 01:24:18,25
And there's again some Mejor something happens to humanity that they need to believe in something new which is what

663
01:24:18,25 --> 01:24:21,00
really you look at the history of religion that's really what happens.

664
01:24:21,00 --> 01:24:23,14
They don't you got to come up with something that's happened

665
01:24:23,14 --> 01:24:30,02
and there is something knows that people need to hold on to as as we are right now and I don't think that will happen.

666
01:24:30,35 --> 01:24:54,33
I mean. Yes. We can we.

667
01:24:54,76 --> 01:24:56,74
For all we know we can be some computers

668
01:24:56,74 --> 01:25:01,95
or somebody else bill that we are just enjoying a little bit about the life you know I guess.

669
01:25:02,00 --> 01:25:04,58
Yes of course of course you know.

670
01:25:05,11 --> 01:25:11,75
And then we get into the on your menu not do you believe in the Christian God or do believe or not these go

671
01:25:11,75 --> 01:25:17,34
or are you completely and I say stand and all those kinds of things you know.

672
01:25:19,04 --> 01:25:28,74
I think it's more in the really believes my family is traditionally a Catholic family. So we.

673
01:25:28,8 --> 01:25:34,52
I guess belief that we are humans and this is the real reality

674
01:25:34,52 --> 01:25:40,19
and hopefully there will be some other some of the reality on our next stage in life.

675
01:25:40,54 --> 01:25:49,69
Now and I don't have an answer for that I have no idea.

676
01:25:49,81 --> 01:25:58,56
I think that again it's going to be a very very individual life style mindset for that you know same as all that

677
01:25:58,56 --> 01:25:59,87
religion that are some drug.

678
01:26:00,01 --> 01:26:05,5
Jones that are to some people feel very crazy but they have a lot of followers and

679
01:26:06,14 --> 01:26:10,41
and some of their religions we are more comfortable and we are the followers or something.

680
01:26:10,43 --> 01:26:14,24
You know so I think that's just part of human life.

681
01:26:14,34 --> 01:26:19,34
I guess or part of humanity some some of us believe in things and some of us don't believe in things.

682
01:26:20,00 --> 01:26:26,21
I don't think we all collectively will believe one just that one thing. Because the never happen.

683
01:26:26,31 --> 01:26:28,53
You never higher than tired

684
01:26:28,53 --> 01:26:39,06
or believe in them the same thing all together so I seen in virtual reality in my develops culls sake's communities.

685
01:26:40,71 --> 01:26:48,19
Party she's never sure what I call it you know. Maybe you know I mean again same as with religion.

686
01:26:48,23 --> 01:26:54,58
Sometimes you will hear something on television some breach happens and.

687
01:26:55,55 --> 01:26:59,37
You're like I wonder how these people actually follow this you know

688
01:26:59,37 --> 01:27:03,54
and then sometimes you hear some others that you know lie or this is really really good.

689
01:27:03,81 --> 01:27:09,78
You know and maybe somebody else is OK how do you know you are crazy how can you believe in that you know. No.
