114:24:39,720 --> 14:24:44,439DO YOU REMEMBER AND COULD YOU DESCRIBE ME YOUR FIRST FOSSIL YOU FOUND?214:24:44,440 --> 14:25:11,839the first fossiles i found was found behind an appartment building where i lived when i was about eleven years old. and i was interested in natural (...) this period of my life i was reader of books about nature animals plants butterflies all stuff like that314:25:11,840 --> 14:25:44,479and i had the chance to visit the natural historic musea in paris with my cousin and my cousin offered me a little book about fossiles and i was very enthusastic about finding fossiles myself. and so using this little book i scouted around the house and luckily well by the way its nothing very surprising i found a .... on a piece of limestone414:25:44,480 --> 14:26:23,639and so i was very happy to connect that with what i had in this book and that was my first fossil. YOU WERE TWELVE YEARS OLD SOMETHING LIKE THAT? WHEN YOU FOUND IT? eleven yeah. AND WHAT DID YOU FIND SO FASCINATING OF THESE FOSSILS. well its a complicated story i was born in Algeria. and i grew up there and i was like 8 years old and i grew up in a very i would say unstable environment. because it was a colonial war there514:26:23,640 --> 14:26:54,919colonial war that turned into be a civilian war actually at the end. and so my childhood was surrounded by very i would say scary environment somehow. and then i was deported outside of the country with my family and i lived in france around paris in not so nice neighbourhood for some years.614:26:54,920 --> 14:27:33,119and i think probably to me natrually story was a sort of escape into a world that was much nicer somehow that was rather (..) or scary environment and when i discovered paleontology when i discovered fossils in this natural history museum i realised that beyond the nature of today there was another nature there were (..) natures and it was like a multiplication of this world.714:27:33,120 --> 14:27:42,879and it was even more fascinating because we did not know everything about these past world and there was a lot to discover814:27:42,880 --> 14:27:53,599AND THE SO THATS WHERE IT STARTED AND WHEN YOU WENT ON LOOKING INTO THE FOSSILS WHAT DID YOU FIND? WHAT DID YOU DISCOVER914:27:53,600 --> 14:28:34,719well i was i think i was a little bit obsessed by fossils in this time period of my life. and so i had the chance at the middle school where i was to meet a professor who was also interested in fossils and paleontology and supported me and pushed me to (..) in this topic. and so i had a lot of activities that were either at school or with this professor and that was around paleontology1014:28:34,720 --> 14:29:12,399we create the ... geology club and we did a lot of excursions to find fossils with other kids and i know i was the most motivated of all of them i was the president of the association chief editor of the journal probably the only reader of the journal. and then so basically i think at this stage of my life i decided what i wanted to do to be. what i wanted to do and i just continued throughout the years to work in this direction1114:29:12,400 --> 14:29:21,479and i never really deviated much. WHAT IS SO FASCINATING FOR YOU NOW IN THIS AGE ABOUT IT?1214:29:21,480 --> 14:29:58,839well now it becomes something a little bit different i would say because now im mostly interested what human fossils and not just reconstructing nature and environment but im working on humans who lived long time before us and these humans are not exaclty like us they share a lot of features they somehow belong to human kind but they are also different in many aspects and so they are a little bit like how to say1314:29:58,840 --> 14:30:41,319(aliens?) somehow i found this extremely fascinating to think on humans which are not completely human like us the other thing is and this also (probably collabs?) with my childhood i think there is something about saving something from death and oblevion and the faith of all living creatures is to dissapear completeley but by chance when we have a fossil of a human who lived (..) million year ago1414:30:41,320 --> 14:31:28,999so suddenly we save something of these lives somehow we resusitate a part of his existance and we can learn things about even his or her daily life so to me its not just a piece of bone its somehow its a person and ofcourse i would say the communication is very limited with this person but there is something like that so its a bit like travelling through time and connecting with a lost world, and discovering things that are somehow unknown to others or known to us and here we are able to unveil something of the past reality1514:31:29,000 --> 14:31:32,599AND WHAT KIND OF HUMANS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?1614:31:32,600 --> 14:32:22,799well today we live in a world where there is only one kind of humans and we are what we call what paleontologists and biologist call modern humans and modern humans are a late version of a species that we call homo sapiens and today this is the only species of humans on earth but when we move back in time it was almost never like that so in the past it was always several groups of humans we dont know if we should call them species or subspecies what is clear that we had groups of humans in the past that were much more different one from the other than any kind of differences that you can see today between modern humans living in different parts of the world.1714:32:22,800 --> 14:33:11,319so its an order of (...) and so just moving lets say hundred thousand years ago we know that we have the answers of modern humans living in africa but on other continents we have neanderthalers in europe and part of asia there is a group living in the forrest that we call deni(...) and it is a group that has been identified by the recently we also know that in some islands of indonesia like flores we have another kind of creature which is probably the descendents of (...) so very (..)(...)1814:33:11,320 --> 14:33:57,839this humans living in flores they are very minute creatures their being called hobbits and all these groups they are quite different from the other what happened at some point is that our incestors the modern humans lived in africa started to expand outside of their geographical domain and they expanded first in south west asia maybe they entered a large portion of asia rather early and then i would say fifty thousand years ago their expansion excelerated a lot1914:33:57,840 --> 14:34:28,159and so they started moving into the domain of the neanderthalers in europe they went to australia they move further ease in the place where the nico(...) livede. eventually they enter in the higher attitudes they passed in america via the (..) and they went to all the most islands (...)2014:34:28,160 --> 14:34:31,999AND WHAT MADE THEM OR US ACTUALLY ARE INCESTORS SO SUCCESFUL?2114:34:32,000 --> 14:35:10,719thats a big mystery actually thats the question we try to understand to resolve. and whats fascinating when one compares modern human neanderthalers other ... of the time period around say hundred to fifty thousand years ago that we see that all these ... are sort of evolving the same direction they have bigger and bigger brains and they have more complex behaviour (...) there a sort of responding the same kind of pressure of selection2214:35:10,720 --> 14:35:55,559but something happen with one of these groups are incestors that gradually met them i would say extremely succesful as a species and when we say succesful for a species it means that this species have a higher reproductive succes than others. and so these humans start to replace all the others we know now that there was a certain level of (..) with loval population and thats an idea that the media and the public like very much2314:35:55,560 --> 14:36:40,879but the truth is that this adm(..) was very reduced in fact very little. a couple of person not more so its primarly a placement of population so there is something with our species which is new in the .... of ..... revolution and this something new could be related to technology for example some people have believed that this modern human had some kind of new tools new weapons some kind of new cognitive abilities maybe something related to the complexity of language for example2414:36:40,880 --> 14:37:23,159it could also be something related to complexity of the social network of these people IN WHAT WAY? well humans are extremely good at creating connections with other humans and not just humans in their direct environment but even humans far away and so now the word when we speak of a group of humans we dont speak about families we talk about network that covers a very large portion of the continent2514:37:23,160 --> 14:38:04,919and we dont know exactly when this developed in the course of human (...) but its very likely that belonging to such a large network is a considerable strenghts if you compete with other (..)who want basically organise the form of local groups which are can be very succesful but with a size of the social network more result this is one idea but there are many others there also many i would say psychological traits of modern human2614:38:04,920 --> 14:38:37,279which ofcourse are very difficult to investigate in the (..) we called but things like if you think on things like altruism or heroism things like that its you know this ability of a individual to lose something for the benefit of others or even to sacrifice himself or self for the survival of others2714:38:37,280 --> 14:39:01,559this also is a remarkable feature of humans again we dont know exactly when in the course of evolution this developed but we can easily imagine that one group having this kind of behaviours that we compete with another group that does not have these kind of features well that would be also a big adventage2814:39:01,560 --> 14:39:05,839AND NOT SO NICE FOR THE COMPETITION AS(...)2914:39:05,840 --> 14:39:57,559yeah but ofcourse today we like to think on humans of the past with i would say with pink glasses so we like to think on (...) of the past neanderthalers or modern humans as pieceful entergather that ... with nature and did not over explode the environment and where nice with others im not so convinced that humans have ever been so good again i think maybe its a memory of my own childhood or life but i know that humans get puberty terrible with others especially others from a different group3014:39:57,560 --> 14:40:15,239and so you cannot your family your children your friends your neigbours and kill other people who have a different language or a different kind of cultural SO IN A WAY HUMANS ARE DANGEROUS AS A SPECIES FOR OTHER SPECIES3114:40:15,240 --> 14:40:50,999well humans actually humans have been dangerous not just for other humans but theyre been dangerous in general for other species. and there is something that could be related to the expansion of modern humans showing that lets say after fifty thousand we see signs of direct impact of the human expansion on the environment and especially on the (..) now ofcourse3214:40:51,000 --> 14:41:28,199there already signs of that further back in the past we see for example when humans stop to hunt on the animals they compete with carnivors and in this competition sometimes carnivors are very good but sometimes humans are better so we have a reduction of a number of carnivors in africa already between two and one million years ago.but when modern humans start to expand out of africa especially when they are going to reach areas where humans never lived before3314:41:28,200 --> 14:41:57,479places where there was no neanderthalers no (...) nothing basic like australia for expample or america so then the impact of these groups is going to be rather terrible on the fauna with ... large animals dissapearing and we think the predation of humans is for something. so AND WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES IT SO DANGEROUS?3414:41:57,480 --> 14:42:39,639well i think probably the difference between modern humans recent modern humans and other hom(..)is that we have a way to explode the resource which is much more intense somehow for example we know that neandertalers in europe could existed with a number of species that are going to dissapear when modern humans arrived and replaced neandertalers by the way in a rather provocative way i could say neandertalers were just like another species of predators that have been eliminated by modern humans3514:42:39,640 --> 14:43:20,359i know its politically incorrect BUT HOW DID WE DO THAT? well for the fauno its quite easy to understand its it looks like the number of praise that we extract from the environment for some species is to high very large animals like say elephants for example they have a rather slow reproduction rate and so if you stop taking to many young individuals at some point it becomes not sustainable for the species3614:43:20,360 --> 14:44:04,959carnivors well you can hunt them directly you can also compete with them for the prize and then the result is more less the same. now for humans its difficult to say because you have many ways one group of humans can replace another and i think in the case of neandertalers we have a competition for the occupation of the europe territory between neandertalers and modern humans i dont think these groups could existed anywhere for a long time i think i (...) he continents they could existed but locally in one region one valley i dont think so3714:44:04,960 --> 14:44:53,599and so you can have a direct i would say conflict you know entergathers i mean recent entergathers they .... war against other groups especially when they compete for resource so you know you kill a man you take the women you oke do things not very nice but then ofcourse there are other factors that can add on that you can be more affective in exploding the environment which means in the end your going to have more children this children have a higher chance of survival and you can also have long higher longevity3814:44:53,600 --> 14:45:39,079higher chance of survival as (...) all these put together especcially if your dealing with groups that are represented by (...) numbers and this is something we is difficult to imagine for us but when we speak about .. modern humans or neandertalers in europe were talking about population size of ten thousand twenty thousand something like that maybe a bit more but were not talking about hundred of thousands or millions so for groups of a i would say a few thousand individual .... difference in demographics succes ...... one to replace another3914:45:39,080 --> 14:46:10,599and then there other things like desease and things like that so .... its a complex process including absorption of some individuals in the group but in the end what is clear is that lets say after fourty thousand years ago in europe in most of europe you have only modern humans maybe there were some neandertalers surviving in a corner in south of ..... or places like that but not for a very long time4014:46:10,600 --> 14:46:52,359and if you look at the genome of the this modern humans in europe in this time periodwe have something like about 4 % of neandertalers dna in their genome and this 4% are going to gradually decrease because there is a selection a nitro selection against this part of the genome and today non african humans carry about 2% of neandertaler genome and we are not sure that in this 2% there are much dna coding for important features4114:46:52,360 --> 14:47:07,679which is another aspect of the problem. AND WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO GO IN THIS SCIENTIFIC FIELD I MEAN LOOKING INTO HUMANS AND NOT IN OTHER SPECIES WHY DID YOU CHOSE THAT4214:47:07,680 --> 14:47:45,839well first of all i continue to be interested in other creatures than human but what i like with human evolution is it allows me to combine my interest for archeology and archeology is the science investigating  the material cultural of humans and trying to understand what is going on in term of technical evolution or other behaviours. for humans4314:47:45,840 --> 14:48:26,439and what is really perculiar with (...) in general and specially more with modern humans is that its impossible to dissantangle cultural evolution and biological evolution and so the whole story of human evolution is an interaction between cultural and social organisation and biology and looking at one without looking at the other is sort of i would say min(..)4414:48:26,440 --> 14:48:34,919AND WHAT MAKES YOU AND YOUR INSTITUTE SO INCREDIBELY GOOD AT IT.4514:48:34,920 --> 14:49:17,719well for me i guess its motivation like for everything in life you have to be very motivated in what you do what ive tried to do when i moved to Leipzig was to create a department where there was this different aspect of human (...) that could be investigated and not just i would say classical methods of human paleontology and .... archeology but putting also on top of that many methods coming what is called archeological sciences which is basically means physics and chemistry4614:49:17,720 --> 14:49:56,719applied to kind of questions we can adress for human evolution and so this concept is something that i did not really invent myself because there are other people who have this idea that basically we had to look at all these aspects of human evolution but as a matter of fact there are very few places on earth if there are any beside here in leipzig where all these aspects all studied by one department4714:49:56,720 --> 14:50:48,639going in to all these directions when i was young scientist i was invited to teach at .... university where there was a professor who was just getting retired francis .... and francis clark howell had a very strong influence on me he was the one who basically proposed this concept of what is called paleontology which is putting together all sort of .... including things like environmental sciences ...... looking at many other aspects of the surroundings of .... to try to deciver human evolution4814:50:48,640 --> 14:51:22,079and clark i would say developed his carreer in academic environment in the us where there was still department of antropology where there was for example cultural antropology and paleontology together and with other things like linguistics or genetics all this in one big department today this is gone. mostly AND THEN NOW ITS ONLY HERE IN LEIPZIG?4914:51:22,080 --> 14:52:03,599its not only here but its mostly here and so i was extremely i would say fortunate to be offer to create this department in this institute because this institute already addresses the question of what makes humans different and to address this question there were already this institue departments like linguistics genetics primotology the study of our direct relatives african apes and asian apes.5014:52:03,600 --> 14:52:34,439people also working on the devolopment of psychology in children and apes and to me it look to me like that was like the best place to devolop my department with people coming with this different disciplines AND WITH MODERN TECHNIQUES OFCOURSE YOU ARE ABLE TO DISCOVER AND UNDERSTAND MORE AND MORE OF THIS HUMAN EVOLUTION5114:52:34,440 --> 14:53:18,599we become much more ambitious today when i started to do paleontology when i was lets say this little boy looking for fossils even when i was a student and doing my phd studying fossils were mostly looking at bumps and holes on bones and making measurements and trying to describe the shape of different fossils and basically grouping them in different species and trying to build up a tree of human evolution and connecting that with ..... and some artifacts...5214:53:18,600 --> 14:53:58,479but today we try to investigate things like diet mobility accesing the genome of fossils its something we even did not think of when i was ...... and now we can say things about you know how connected were the father and the mother of a neandertaler who lived 45.000 years ago. and we can say oh this parent the mother and the father they could have been maybe half siblings or cousins or things like that5314:53:58,480 --> 14:54:33,799we can say things about the mobility of humans in the landscape we can say even things about the way they explode the fauna what kind of if the animals they are hunting or coming from far away or there local animals so we can really say a lot of things about i would say about their daily life in the mean time ofcourse there is a sort of frustrating limit that seems still impossible5414:54:33,800 --> 14:55:05,279sometimes im asked what would you like to know about neandertalers for example and as a joke a couple of times i said oh i would like to know what kind of relationship neandertalers had with his little brother in law and i think yeah this is really what would be really important for example to figure out what could have been a difference between neandertalers and modern humans im not sure we know that ever5514:55:05,280 --> 14:55:09,639BUT THAT IS A LIMIT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CROSS.5614:55:09,640 --> 14:55:45,079yeah sure i think there is a  difficulty of ... and the difficulty comes from the fact that its a paradox but there is a great interest of the public for origins people want to know about origin they want to know about neandertalers and modern humans and its incredibly popular. somehwo its great because i guess this is how i could make a job of this interest5714:55:45,080 --> 14:56:33,239in the mean time it results in the construction of mythology i would say that is a sort of scientific mythology that we placed a religous believe in the past so all human societies have their myth of religion western societies they have priestery and palenteology and so the result of that is that there is a lot of storytelling for basically to ... the lack of information we have in many aspects of the nature and the life of ancion humans.5814:56:33,240 --> 14:57:23,959and so we ... to this sort of pressure of the environment and the public the media for us to tell stories and so there are many topics for which we have to use our imagination to basically fill the gaps and so this is where its a bit problematic because i think we fill the gap with conceptions that are mostly depending on the ideology of the historical period we live. and so i always want the students even scientific papers about seperating the evidence the scientific results and the storytelling5914:57:23,960 --> 14:58:03,639what is always a little bit of storytelling. AND WHAT KIND OF STORYTELLING SHOULD I THINK OF? its quite obvious that for example this question of the difference between neandertalers and modern humans or the replacement proces of neandertalers by modern humans and things like that. are deeply influenced by scenarios that we have in mind and which are not always just a deduction from the emperical evidence that we have frome sides.6014:58:03,640 --> 14:59:07,199and if you for example like to think that antion entergathers was you know as i said pieceful entergathers were procupied by ecology and not discriminating this poor neandertalers your going to build of stories around that. and i think our fuel is easily filled with this kind of thing and if you move further back in time i think we have a fundamental misunderstanding of what .... were. because the natural transform  for humans is to project themself in the past. so when we speak about ..... living a million and a half years ago rather naturally we see them as humans of today that we not have all the technology6114:59:07,200 --> 14:59:43,599that we have and maybe a smaller brain but basically we were very close to other we be better health a bit stronger but they would see the world like we see it and than we would see ... as we see each other. and i think this is completely wrong in fact but for millenia humans have build up this vision of the world where they are there is us and the rest of the world. for example we see us as completeley separated from animals.6214:59:43,600 --> 15:00:17,839when in fact when you look at many of the human features that had been for long time believe to be proper to humans you will find out that you will find all this things in many other species. ofcourse not with the degree of complexity or the degree of intensity that you see in human but you will find it so in other words there is not a very well cut limit6315:00:17,840 --> 15:01:02,919between the humans and the others and so there is this grey zone where we have ..... which to me again i found it absolutley  fascinating but for many people including in my field of science yeah there is this sort of tendency to separate what is the real humans and something much more different then primitives before. and so in ofhter words we have a tendency to humanise as much as possible everything which is close to us in time and then beyond a certain point6415:01:02,920 --> 15:02:10,599then we basically see everthing like very primitive very different and so this border has been moving through time so for some people humans start with ..... homo for other humans start with modern humans and you have almost everything in between. and ofcourse the reality is much more complex. there is a sentence in a book by a famous french writer called .... who wrote a book about the democracy in america and in this book .... say somehwere that any wrong idea but that would be very simple and very clear would be always much more succesful than a complicated but true concept. and i think its very true also6515:02:10,600 --> 15:02:30,239in science and in my science especcially ITS ALSO ACTUALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT ITS WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM YOUR SCIENTIFIC FIELD CAN HELP US ALSO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE HUMAN SPECIES IN THE FUTURE6615:02:30,240 --> 15:03:09,639i think yes somehow you can see the ... of human evolution like a sort of substitute for a mythology a myth of origin and ofcourse it is a science but ... this mythological dimension also. but recently i think there is another sort of aspect that has been developing a lot which is trying to understand the wayh humans evolve in the past and the way humans interacted with other species and with a ... in general6715:03:09,640 --> 15:03:52,039give us a sort of deeper perspective on what could be the future of human evolution and this is rather new i would say .... for humans. humans have been always procupied what is going to happen in the future. but for example the notion that humans are changing the climate the notian that humans are pushing to extinction so many species something rather new at the scale of human evolution i would say6815:03:52,040 --> 15:04:28,039so its really a historical process that is just very close to us so many people worry about the fact that since the global warming has been discovered we dont do much well as a matter of fact if again if you think on deep historiy i found remarkable that so soon after finding out something is going on that we already trying to find solution and somehow im rather optimistic i think humans will find solutions and try to change that6915:04:28,040 --> 15:04:57,199but again to sort of have an influance of this interaction between humans and the environment is very important to have the background to understand what was before and how humans have already altered the planet there is another aspact which is the biological and even social evoltution of humans there are many practical things like for example our diet7015:04:57,200 --> 15:05:35,239you know the way we eat we feed our bodies its something today that become is becoming a problem for humans. a lot of obese people why? well there is a evolutionary explanation for that we have adaptation that were design somehow for a different style of life and so the fact that humans have devolop very ... features in the past to be succesful its very important fo figure out why we are where we are today7115:05:35,240 --> 15:06:10,999and even going deeper into for example questions that.... become really i would say dramatically important like acting on our own genome. again its dramatically important to understand what has been the past evolution of humans and you know how selection worked on humans and why humans are what they are before we started to play with our own genes.7215:06:11,000 --> 15:06:45,719its a new chapter of life evolution starting because it never happened before that one species living species could take the control of the genome of other species to this extand in a sort of delibarate way and then started to somehow take the control of its own genome. BUT THAT MADE ALSO THE HUMAN SPECIES SO SUCCESFUL WE WERE ALWAYS ABLE TO7315:06:45,720 --> 15:07:21,839yeah but i would say we are we are all succesful and dangerous and its because were dangerous that we have been succesful somehow. but now we have to be careful with this notion of danger and succes because maybe there is a level of danger that ultimately would hurt our succes so in other words we are to think a lot on and i think we do it.7415:07:21,840 --> 15:07:43,079actually i think i found it somehow admirable somehow ofcourse we dont do it as much as we should but at least there are people doing it and again if you think on the past history of humans for the last millenia its something really new somehow.7515:07:43,080 --> 15:07:46,039AND WE CREATE NEW SPECIES. TECHNICAL SPECIES7615:07:46,040 --> 15:08:50,919yeah we oh you know something really  amazing there are many things amazing about human evolution but there is onte thing that i like to think of is the way humans have externalised bilogical function. in their technical or social environment and there would be we could speak for hours about this but this is really something fascinating and by the way it explains why cultural and social evolution is so basically into ... with the biological evolution and humans have this very perculiar ... in nature. that they create complex societies they create artifacts they have this ... to do more and more complexity and to do that they need a big brain7715:08:50,920 --> 15:09:20,639and not just a big brain but a good big brain. and this big brain is fantastic we can do amazing things with our brain. no need to tell that but this big brain has a cost and the cost is very  high it is very high in term of ..... its very high in term of mentenance and all sort of other things7815:09:20,640 --> 15:09:50,279it has a very high price in terms of producing other humans babies and children and excetera and so we had to change a lot of thigns in our biology to accomadate this very costly organ. and when we say we had to change it was not a deliberate decision of humans its natural selection that pushed us into this direction. and so we have reorganised a lot of things7915:09:50,280 --> 15:10:22,959in our biology physicology to make this possible this evolution things like our diet again the way we were produce things like that. in the meantime this has been possible because of the technical environment that we created if you think for example on diet we can extract much more calories from our food to fuel our costly brain8015:10:22,960 --> 15:11:22,559because we have weapens that in the past were used to kill animals in distance we had tools to ... de carcases of this animal we were able to later we have learned how to cook food to prepare the food we eat etcetera and so in other words things that were basically end on by our organism in the past have been dedicated to things which are external to our body and this is .. for other aspects not just in the technical or material domain but also in the social domain like for example the brain is very costly for an adult.even more costly for a child8115:11:22,560 --> 15:11:58,279and its a big issue if you think on that for a mother to be able to fuel and maintain our own brain and in the meantime to devolop a baby with a brain that is also very costly and so we gradually we started to have very picular way to give birth to children. and we gave birth to children with a brain which is unfinished i mean for most men was the brain is unfinished at birth but our brain is really unfinished.8215:11:58,280 --> 15:12:23,439and so most of the ... of the brain accurs after birth especially the wiring of the brain so this wiring develop when you are interacting with the environment which by the way makes it even more efficient and complex its a little bit like you would remodel a computer that you would be using for different tasks you know.8315:12:23,440 --> 15:13:03,199but then there is another sort of layer on that is that by ... our children very early and making them able to eat solid food before their brain become to big it became possible for the females to share the ... of fuelling the brain of the developing children with other adults of the group so we became cooperative breaders and so the you know the raising children is the collective venture8415:13:03,200 --> 15:13:38,399BUT NOW WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO EXTERNALISE THE BRAIN WE MAKE ARTIFICIAL BRAIN exactly so now we continue to externalise we externalise memory and this started already with coding things the writing is alread i mean just respresenting pictures symbols was already away to externalise something out of our brain then second major step was writing because then writing was you know8515:13:38,400 --> 15:14:03,839you could store as almost as much as information you wanted without having to ... in your brain. you know when writing was invented there are people and still the ... greeks or the ... in europe worried about writing because they had this fear that people would lose their ability to remember things because they had these easy way to record things8615:14:03,840 --> 15:15:12,039i mean ... greeks some ... greeks. but now ofcourse we go mucht further with digital storage of information and by the way externing this i mention already this ability and this need of humans for building up networks. now this networks are planetory networks and again its fuel technology that we have been able to do that. but i think the following step would be a sort of  reinternalisation of what we have externalise as devices. so in other words this is a bit of science fiction but people worry a lot about intelligent machines robots basically a competition between humans and artifical intelligence8715:15:12,040 --> 15:16:13,639i think we internalise the artificial intelligence so it would not be anymore external but internal somehow and people have tried already to implant chips electronic chips in parts of the brain of animals and there are some attemps with humans also so ..... it would be about memory but could be for other functions and basically we are very far from being side.... buti think the notion that we can sort of .... some humans abilities in an artifical way its on the table and its something that is more and more consider i think it would be together with ... genome and the way we track with the environment the genome of other creatures8815:16:13,640 --> 15:16:40,919these are big ethical issues for humans not for the future for today and again i think its dramatically important to have a perspective about where we come from and why we are here to basically be able to had all these questions. many of these questions that today are discussed if you think on that for example8915:16:40,920 --> 15:17:05,079artificial procreation or the you know basically external rising reproduction. people think its something completley you know crazy and something that developed in post modern societies with people doing sort of crazy experiments and experiments and things like that9015:17:05,080 --> 15:17:45,359as a palenteologist i have a different view i think its just the continuation of things we have been doing for a long time already in the .... ofcourse it is very spectacular its very extreme but somehow if you think on that its persue regarding reproduction our production as modern humans is as been ment possible because we created an artifical environment around reproduction and when i say we create an artificial environment im not talking about medical progress in the 20th century9115:17:45,360 --> 15:18:56,880im talking about ... times but basically the way i mean the possibility to have this so immature .... surviving and developing all this communitive skills and being maintain for twenty years before they become adults and reproduce and be part of the society as been meant possible only because with our big brain we created technical environment and a social environment for that. and so again what we see in modern society is just like the continuation of this trend. now ofcourse its up to us to decide what is good or bad and how far i mean when i say good or bad im not talking about religious believes but im talking about what could be counter productive for a species....
