115:31:52,440 --> 15:32:02,119CAN YOU TELL ME WHATS THE MAIN QUESTION YOUR LOOKING FOR WHICH YOUR LOOKING FOR ANSWERS IN YOUR SCIENTIFIC FIELD215:32:02,120 --> 15:32:28,719the scientific field is addressing a large number of questions and so.315:32:28,720 --> 15:32:34,199SO WOULD YOU TELL ME WHAT ARE THE QUESTIONS YOUR LOOKING FOR ANSWERS FOR.415:32:34,200 --> 15:33:01,719the field adresses many questions and this is due to the fact that ... evolution covers several ...... and a whole variety of species that exist during this time period there is one thing that is important to realise is that we know only a portion and maybe only a small portion of these groups of homo..... that existed in the past515:33:01,720 --> 15:33:40,399so they are time cariers and regions for which we have no information at all and does not mean that there was nothing there just mean that we dont know. so basically we have a pile of cut branches and we try to build a tree but we dont have all the branches and so somehow the tree we build is not so accurate that we think it is so thats one part of the story which is bascially looking for fossils finding new homo.... and completing this big puzzle615:33:40,400 --> 15:34:29,039again remember that out of this complex bush today there is just on branch that sticks out and gave birth to our species. so beside that there are many questions about what are humans and how differet they are from other creatures so in other words we have a part of the field which is not really looking at the past but is more looking at humans of today and analising for example the differences that we can detect or study between apes and humans715:34:29,040 --> 15:35:19,599we know that african apes especially chimpansees are very closely related to us. and so somehow studying living primates is very important or so. and after we identify some key aspects of humans for example or things about their ofcourse their anatomy their big brain their reduced dentition things like that. their diet but also aspects of their social organisation reproductive pattern development pattern. psychology so then the game is to go to this tree815:35:19,600 --> 15:36:04,079that is our remind you and the incomplete tree and try to find out where this different features develop and why and how along these different branches. and what emerging today is this picture that in fact all these branches somehow achieved a certain kind of human kind somehow but not completley like us and so they have some of these features not others and were just at the beginning of understanding that and trying to deciver the complexity of this evolution.915:36:04,080 --> 15:36:46,199and recently what happened in the field is that we had very fast development of ... genetic studies and there is this other way to look at the past which is i would say a ... way to dna also to engine proteins now people study proteins and try to make .... and all these molecular information provide us with all sort of other information but also many new questions that we never invision before WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS?1015:36:46,200 --> 15:37:29,079well so far biogenetics has been mostly dealing with what we call (filogony?) which is basically the construction of the tree. so how one group is related to another when was their split point in the past information about demography were this groups large or small did they suffer demographic crashes bottle necks for example and then we have discovered that the level of admixture of all these groups1115:37:29,080 --> 15:38:12,879is more higher and more consistent than we think. it was. actually this is nothing proper to humans now that we are able to ... evolution sequency of many many creatures. we see that this story of species intermixing a little bit its common its exist among primates among elephants among horses among carnivores everywhere basically all species that were not seperated for more than say 5 million years they can more as interbread.1215:38:12,880 --> 15:38:46,959there is one thing that pa....genetics and genetics so far is not really able to address or start to question is what we call ..... expression so in other words when we find a difference in the genome what does it mean. in term of features is it something first of all we know that some differences have no effect on the... times. so its nothing we can detect as a difference1315:38:46,960 --> 15:39:16,239in the meantime somtime a small difference can result in a major effect. in the ... times so among three billions and half of nucler.... in the dna we know some mutation that just change one out of more than three billion can have a dramatic effect. on how one individual looks like1415:39:16,240 --> 15:39:47,719but so we are now at a stage where we know that a certain number of ... genes that are present in all modern humans are absent in neandertalers or ... and conversely there are some versions of some genes which are not found in modern humans bt are in neandertalers what does it mean. in term of anatomy biology behaviour brain development whatever1515:39:47,720 --> 15:40:06,159we dont its always frustrating when you are ... oh you find this genes so what does it mean and in general they say we dont know. and thats a fiel thats also developing now. people are trying to find ways to resolve that.1615:40:06,160 --> 15:40:55,199and there is lot of work i think there are going to manage in the near future to ...some quetions some answers. ITS A GREAT TIME TO BE WHAT YOU ARE. yes when i was a phd student i was a bit depressed i mean thats probably the normal destiny of a phd student i guess but i have this feeling that i was born to late in the world to old and that many issues about what i was interested in neandertalers homo rectus homo sapiens etcetera has been already investigated by very bright scientists1715:40:55,200 --> 15:41:26,599i could not be more wrong than that. because in fact first of all since i was a student there is a number of new groups of homo.... that has been found. incredible. second there many aspects of the biology and behaviour of .... homo... that we could not conceive to be accesible to scientific investigation1815:41:26,600 --> 15:42:01,519so the methadology have been developing at an incredible speed so in other words what im saying is that primarly i witness more progresses in the in my field since i was a student and today they are probably in the previous .... century so i think its a very exciting time and i dont think there are reasons why this would stop. you know i tell young student scientists is say you know is going to continue1915:42:01,520 --> 15:42:42,079and ofcourse there are some issues with the development of all this new methodologists because sometimes they are very costly they are very sophisticated even on a personal level they demand a lot of investments from the scientists in the way that in order to master this methadology you hard to become very specialised sometime i feel that we are going to miss people are more generally somehow i see myself as a generalist2015:42:42,080 --> 15:43:07,959it was always my problem i was interested in to many things varied. somehow it was a great chance that i was given this posibillity to build up a department where i can hire people who do all the things we never do because i cannot do everyting but basically dedicating all these projects to other people.2115:43:07,960 --> 15:43:39,359but again i think its always important when you do science and when you study and you are very good very expert in a narrow field you can be the best but its very important to step back and know understand what is the big picture and where are your little piece of the puzzle fits into this big picture2215:43:39,360 --> 15:43:41,879WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?2315:43:41,880 --> 15:43:55,959nothing. you mean for my field? for in general. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN LAY AWAKE IN BED ABOUT.2415:43:55,960 --> 15:44:32,399not much in fact. ofcourse im anxious about details i would say sometimes we have a paper we want to publish its very important to us. and it ... for some reason its stressing its ... all the project we would like to do and it does not work sometimes for i would say for political reasons in the broad sense2515:44:32,400 --> 15:45:16,679interaction with others competition with other groups but in general these issues they are much more i would say problematic for young scientists starting in the field for me its i would say i suffer for them. but i dont take it personally to much at heart in fact the only thing im i fear is not working anymore. is basically getting retired and not being able to do what im doing every day2615:45:16,680 --> 15:45:48,119and i think this is not a very original fear but i think its a fear that many scientsts have and clearly the day i wont have anymore the capability to develop on this project to follow them to support students or young scientists its a great thing to be able to work everyday with young people who have a lot of great ideas and basically say lets do it.2715:45:48,120 --> 15:45:54,119and help them to do it. so yeah this day i fear it a little bit2815:45:54,120 --> 15:46:13,999DURING HISTORY PALEONTEOLOGY HAS BEEN MISUSED ALSO AS A OR PARTICULARY IDEALISTIC FROM AN IDEALISTIC POINT HOW DO YOU SEE THAT2915:46:14,000 --> 15:47:01,159i think the field is strongly influenced by the ideology of the time .... or also by the sometime by political power by i would say national reason for example. so there are many stories involved how people have been buyers in the way they interpeted the ....logical evidence. in particular based on national issues and so3015:47:01,160 --> 15:47:36,439i would say rarely i mean speaking  of ..... is not true for archeology for more reasons period speaking of .... archeology there are a view examples where we can say there is in major misuse of the field. i see more this as a i would say a polution of the scientific speech by conception which are not scientific.3115:47:36,440 --> 15:48:08,399and i think we have to live with it somehow we have to accept it we have to by the way to live with that is to be aware of this i think a common mistake today is to think that this was true in the 19th century or the beginning of the 20th century but that today its you know we are good scientists and were free from all these things. i think we are not more free today than what we were a century ago3215:48:08,400 --> 15:48:13,719and i see that everyday. IN WHAT WAY DO YOU SEE THAT.3315:48:13,720 --> 15:48:45,839well i see that that there are i would say there are fashions in the field. even for example the way .homo.... are represented we are often ask to provide pictures of this ...... and we easily make fun of the reconstruction that we made a century ago somehow i think our representation today are also sort of funny3415:48:45,840 --> 15:49:21,839if you go to the neandertaler museum in ... near dusseldorf they have a reconstruction of a neandertaler with a suit and a tie which is watching the visitors i think this is the expression of a conception that we have today of how we want to think of the neandertaler like other humans just like modern humans almost3515:49:21,840 --> 15:50:23,919but i think as long as the representation of neanderthal i can go ... and escape from the ... i think so we sort of add on this material i would say filosofical or ideolical conception that we have today. now what is clear is that if you think on the past if you think especcially in the 20th century you also see how i would say political situations could influence the field. when colonia is something more common it has an impact on the field. and the way peoples saw human evolution. for example for a long period europe was seen as the center of human evolution3615:50:23,920 --> 15:50:57,959just because your up the center of the world. and so it was difficult to think thad modern humans of today did not originate from europe.and their models in the first half of the 20th century where in which all the groups of living humans of today african ... europeans or asians. were originate from different sides of europe you know now we find it funny but people even ridiculous but people not think this way3715:50:57,960 --> 15:51:52,279in the 1930 or 40 WHERE DID THEY ORIGINATE FROM? THE HUMANS? well the modern humans originated in africa and they expanded out of africa and even after you say that you dont really always measure what it means it means that modern humans as ... to us to modern europeans when they arrived in the middle attitude of (erasia?) sau 50 to 40.000 years ago they were probably black guys you know and they change their .... to addapt to the local condition. or i better say their filotype changed to adapt to the local condition3815:51:52,280 --> 15:52:43,399so and even today they are groups of scientist who are not very comfortable with the african origins of modern humans. for example if you look at the chines literature in the field its very easy to detect that especcially if you move back not very far in time. you see that there is a discomfort with the african modern origin. and there is a long tradition of seeing the human evolution in asia3915:52:43,400 --> 15:53:56,519as a distinct process of what has been going on in other continents europe or africa so that the ideas that basically modern chinese would originate in order homo..... in china and that could go back to .....in china and so in other words a difficulties thinking that this is not somehow stain by some form of nationalism. so this idea that humans to start with the generous homo originated in one place or another its something which has been very popular but which is far from being demonstrated but now if you go today in south africa or in the tropia or in kenia or tanzania people will take your hand and take you to the cradle of human kind somewhere so there are several cradles competing on with the other4015:53:56,520 --> 15:54:39,359well i dont know maybe there is no cradle maybe its a much larger region. now for modern humans this notion that modern humans originated in what has been called sometimes a garden of eden by the way you see the connection with the biblical mythology has been always very popular since this notion of african origin developed .and so this garden has been seen in different parts of ... africa. where im not sure that the reality of the data really confirms that4115:54:39,360 --> 15:55:24,839bt the origin of modern humans has been always a topic where i would say political ideological nationalist issues has been involveld somehwo so before the second world war there was this idea that modern humans originated in europe and then during the nazi regime there was even archeologies that tried to prove that modern humans emerge in germania and they well they got some support from the nazi regime.4215:55:24,840 --> 15:56:10,159to demonstrate that and today still this debate about where al the oldest modern humans its still there.so people fight about different parts of africa or there some people who will think maybe it is in asia that modern humans emerged. and again i think its very difficult to think that your not influenced by your direct environment because first of all you your more ... to advocate for origin in the place that you know where you have been studying different size and fossils etcetera.4315:56:10,160 --> 15:57:03,239in the end i think i see science as a .... process. so there are many wrong ideas even if sometime they are popular its not the very democratic activity. so the history of science is full of popular ideas that have been proven to be wrong. even if they were supported by a large number of people but somtimes they have been falsified by minorities or even single individuals and so there is this sort of darwinian process that basically loads this renewal of our ideas. one difficulty with paleontology is that is very something that is often missing which is replication.4415:57:03,240 --> 15:58:14,719of the result. and i think a key aspect of modern science is repicabilaty so if you produce any result it should be replicated by others to be confirmed. its not always possible. in archeology or in paleontology why? because there are fields which are basically build up around sites so a place somewhere on earth and objects and in general these sites or this objects their controlled by individuals or groups or countries. and so as a good story has been ellaborated around an object or a site and that this good story is somehow very supportive for a individual or a group or a nation this individual this group or this nation they are not going to be very willing4515:58:14,720 --> 15:59:04,239to let other people come and check if its true or not. so it takes a long time in the field of paleontology sometimes to falsify results. and when it happens sometimes its a bit sort of scandalous we are just publishing a paper that is going to come out friday. i can speak about it because its re..... will not be on air before. but we have been asked by a... to redate fossil that has been studied by others and this fossil has been published in major journals as an hybride of neanderthals and modern humans4615:59:04,240 --> 15:59:47,799and by redating this material we found that that first of all its very recent and you cannot be a hybride of neanderthal and modern humans be that other fragments of humans that has been found around are not human in fact and finaly investigating the dna of these things we found out that its certainly not an hybride of neanderthals and modern humans but a recent human primarly of ... time. but i predict that the publication of this paper is going to be not well taken not just by the people who published the first ... but im not sure that in general the field likes that4715:59:47,800 --> 16:00:07,519so somehow we its always difficutlt to be the one who somehow creates some kind of little scandal about a nice story that has been around for a while.4816:00:07,520 --> 16:00:20,999YOU ARE ALWAYS LOOKING IN TO THE FOSSILS INTO THE WILD WOULD YOU ALSO LIKE TO DISCOVER THE ORBID the what? THE ORBIDS THE STARS?4916:00:21,000 --> 16:01:36,559by the way ive been interested in astronomy when i was a kid also and even still have a telescope a good one in my basement. but no i never consider of making a profession of something like that. ive been interested in other things first of all in my own field i think in another life i would like to do other things that i could not do in this one but outside the scientific field i think i would have been very interested in another type of creation like architecture or art. im very impressed by art i was a couple of days ago i was in paris and had a chance to have dinner with first of all to attend a presentation and have dinner with anischka poul is a very famous english indian sculpture.5016:01:36,560 --> 16:02:08,399and im always impresses by the way artists are able to explore the reality of things in a very different way then scientists but I HAVE AN OTHER QUESTION ALSO JULIA ... SUBSCRIBES THAT THROUGH HUMANS THE UNIVERSE HAS BECOME AN CONSISNOUS OF ITSELF BECAUSE OF OUR BRAINS WE ARE NOW CREATING A KIND OF MIND OF THE UNIVERSE AN YOU ELIBERATE A BIT ON THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT5116:02:08,400 --> 16:03:23,119wel i tend to think on humans as a sort of collective brain and probably what is most impressive about humans is that humans as individuals they are very sort of weak and limited creatures is difficult to think on a human like a very dangerous creature for nature or other animals but humans have through their evolution able to create social groups and then networks of social groups and networks that were always more extanded and today we have this sort of almost collective intelligence of humans which something that we do everyday that to me still is amazing is the fact when you miss an information you can sort of find it almost instantly in the collective brain of all human of earth5216:03:23,120 --> 16:04:18,759to go on internet and i wont say the word but you know type certain name and you get all sort of information about that and so this capability to put in relation intelligence and memory of all humans is absolutley fascinating and it goes much beyond information or basically recording of any thing its also the capability that humans have to add expertise in a way that they can produce amazing results so somehow the main difference between us i mean when i say us i mean modern humans of today5316:04:18,760 --> 16:04:56,639and a neanderthal or an older homo.... is that probably most of this people were able to do everyting they needed to do to make their life possible and ofcourse for us its completley different and almost every single object that are the .... but not just objects many surfaces and functions in the modern societies are ...possible by the addition of the expertise of many many people5416:04:56,640 --> 16:05:29,039so the example which is often given is you know a .... from basically nobody would be able to build this .... but by hiding many many people were able to conceive and to produce all the parts of the .... and the software and everthing we have this amazing object. so this notion that humans represent a sort of network of memory and concious today is quite striking with especcially the internet5516:05:29,040 --> 16:06:15,599and the interconnection of many individuals. is not a completley new idea somehow cause you know if you move back in the 19th century you had people who today it seems a bit strange but we may think of that who would seperated in nature a vegetal rain. a animal rain and a human rain and just yesterday i was reading a chapter of a book by ..... a very famous naturalist just after french revolution5616:06:15,600 --> 16:06:50,239and .... developing this book in this notion of human brain and his argument is exactly this one is the notion that humans they have a queit something that the rest of nature does not have is this selfconciousnes and so especcially als you see humans as a big network is a sort of self consiousness of the universe itselff somehow. at least the living creatures on one planet.5716:06:50,240 --> 16:07:41,119what i found a paradox and im a bit torn by that somehow ofcourse humans are absolutley unique in many aspects but in the meantime we know how they would in the living world and we know that the ... very close to apes like chimpanesees and bonobo's and so in other words i think this notion that ofcourse the notion of human brain is kind of rediculous because we belong to the animal brain ofcourse and is not just that we belong to the animal world actually we are some kind of bizarre apes very close from one species of other apes than chimpansees5816:07:41,120 --> 16:08:31,519and a species which is further away from things like oerang oetangs or ... or things like that so we tend to develop this notion of acceptionolism of humans but to some extand its true ofcoourse with living humans with modern humans and i mention many aspects that make them absolutiley unique in the history of life. in the meantime i think we are to be ... not to project or extand this notion of exceptionolism in to the past. because if we move into the past5916:08:31,520 --> 16:09:09,319homo.... that lived 100, 200, 500 thousand years ago i think they were just like another species of animals on earth and they are something a bit unusual carnivore roots predatory apes you know want to run after animals and catch them and eat them but in term of simply in term of numbers there were nothing remarkable nothing really visible in the ... i would say6016:09:09,320 --> 16:10:15,799and if you think for example on the competition between humans and carnivores there are places on earth where obviously humans sort of succeeded in this competition but there are other places where its not so obvious for a long time and so for example we think that the development of human groups say before .... year ago in europe was probably somehow limitied by the reach and dangerous variety of large carnivores existing in this part of the planet and so it took us some time to take over the situation. so again i think we should reframe ourself from projecting in the past what humans are today or how we want to see us today and i think this is the main problem it has been always a problem in paleontology6116:10:15,800 --> 16:10:42,039somehow even people working on homo... living 2 milion years ago or more wanted to see them like a version a little bit primitive then moder humans running around in the savanne i mean villages and meeting every night to tell stories to each other which i think is a fantasy6216:10:42,040 --> 16:10:51,999LAST QUESTION YOU WERE IN OUR SERIES IS IN ARCHETYPES EVERY EPISODE HAS AN ARCHETYPE YOU ARE IN THE CONQUER DOES THAT FIT WELL?6316:10:52,000 --> 16:12:14,799well you mean a conquer i cant ... that always one way is as an individual and another way is regarding my topic. of research so as an individual have been always a rather ambitious person i think and i my first years on earth were very challenging in many ways and i could not have survived i could say a difficult start and i was poor. and so i was a immigrant i was a refugee and i had this kind of i think retrospectively i can see that has this sort of rage of you know managing and doing well in life and being succesful in reaching my goals and even from a matter important view to be you know on the safe side i would say6416:12:14,800 --> 16:13:07,479so yeah conquear my mother would like that probably if she would hear that now if you think on my topic of my main topic of interest certainly you can see the evolution of humans as a sort of epic story of an conquest of the planet by a species. i try to keep a cool brain somehow about that because this is something you find a lot in the literature also in the popular literature the tv documentaries in films and i think its a sort of retrospective way we have to tell the story6516:13:07,480 --> 16:13:48,839and it meets this storytelling which is so popular about the mythology of our species the mythology of our human society modern societies i think somehow humans have been driven into this ecological needs first completley by chance i would say and the fact is that we are lucky to be humans and not to be a dangerous species on earth6616:13:48,840 --> 16:14:31,279but we have to remember that many other homo...human existed on earth and they are not here anymore and so that should maybe give us a level of modesty or a maybe you know its a sort of warning that we have to be carful because species are mortal and evolution is mostly about extinction so its nice that we have this level of conciousness that allow us to speak about it and to analyse a lot of things6716:14:31,280 --> 16:15:27,680but so lets be wise somehow so we have been conquered by accident but lets say lets be wise men now.
