1
00:00:00,07 --> 00:00:09,01
Where did it start for you were. You were not ready for marriage for proof. So where did it start when I started.

2
00:00:09,18 --> 00:00:11,1
I mean I was turning in with people stunned

3
00:00:11,1 --> 00:00:19,23
or I had my age you can say don't don't mind something to factor in such a way that my father used to give me somebody

4
00:00:19,23 --> 00:00:23,37
will convert boycotts. Unlike other kids. I like to play with eat.

5
00:00:23,58 --> 00:00:31,88
I'd like to play in grade school enjoy and get happiness to do it but one in the last Huntsman that.

6
00:00:31,9 --> 00:00:34,48
That was why why is what going like this.

7
00:00:36,01 --> 00:00:41,37
I almost gave us came I said Why with when I keep on asking such questions that keeps.

8
00:00:42,87 --> 00:00:47,74
A school in my mind so because I had been there.

9
00:00:47,87 --> 00:00:52,89
You may at least general does that current flows from back to the mode of.

10
00:00:53,41 --> 00:00:57,98
Clear weather and place which you had to with a straight jacket and pulls from back into the modem.

11
00:00:58,91 --> 00:01:01,84
But you're doing that and we're going to go.

12
00:01:01,85 --> 00:01:08,00
There's a three more bit is a quad there's no way absolutely nineteen is how they're going to screw it so that was

13
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:08,84
really cute As for me

14
00:01:08,84 --> 00:01:16,28
and in the beginning I go there to buy these hoping it might be some ghost might have entered in had to got those.

15
00:01:16,29 --> 00:01:18,29
I used to want some like Ghost

16
00:01:18,29 --> 00:01:24,68
and we're going to see those items on the bush my the Internet about that's what it is like being in bed with ten up

17
00:01:24,68 --> 00:01:25,4
are going to go through this.

18
00:01:25,43 --> 00:01:33,35
I might be exposed to how discoursed exactly looks like so I tried that and I know that you had any small O.B.E.

19
00:01:33,35 --> 00:01:42,47
Looking to get just one small instrument is it better not to get a small it's got on with the undead in the screws up

20
00:01:42,48 --> 00:01:51,29
on the box and while that was ideally interesting but I mean which really attracted me and get a better technology

21
00:01:51,3 --> 00:02:01,41
and gadgets. So I just so I just explored I just followed sort of created a so and while that that is something. Woods.

22
00:02:01,69 --> 00:02:10,18
I was expecting though so I just I don't mean it's what it says for your latest problem glad I'm satisfied R.D.S.

23
00:02:11,52 --> 00:02:14,79
You have finally admitted to place a bag to go in a book.

24
00:02:15,23 --> 00:02:18,34
You just drag in the screw and I paid the street a little more.

25
00:02:19,55 --> 00:02:25,63
So yeah one day I was here alone in my room and my parents read it out for the scalping and

26
00:02:25,63 --> 00:02:31,37
when I was alone I was my notice mind kept exploding one being that makes trouble.

27
00:02:32,26 --> 00:02:37,05
I would be for not all that occasional busy and all that activity but I was no doubt seen hacking gadgets

28
00:02:37,05 --> 00:02:39,32
and on their dad was in the past and from my childhood.

29
00:02:40,41 --> 00:02:49,03
So I so want to live my father's probably stories about what who had so one day those so one their lives are one

30
00:02:49,99 --> 00:02:52,95
and that was it that daily present in their lives.

31
00:02:53,04 --> 00:02:57,6
That would be because in this small boy God there was that most such good.

32
00:02:58,06 --> 00:03:01,14
So how big could we get a book straight people

33
00:03:02,02 --> 00:03:10,45
and those days we don't do it all that because at least for a couple of games with nosebag I mean we used to have their

34
00:03:10,45 --> 00:03:11,39
books.

35
00:03:13,57 --> 00:03:22,35
And Lego does the Such beautiful images that they do where interested let's give this woman that we used to do is so I

36
00:03:22,35 --> 00:03:29,53
decided to close that I just I know that one small instrument is going to he's got it from somewhere and again.

37
00:03:30,02 --> 00:03:34,36
On the screen you see when I just open the box.

38
00:03:35,58 --> 00:03:40,81
That was really just not for me I had like I just explained that

39
00:03:40,81 --> 00:03:45,82
and wow this is something done not by God like something a president that the president thought of me

40
00:03:47,7 --> 00:03:57,02
and then just I just like like we had a collecting on the boards and bang was about a little bit of me so i told us.

41
00:03:58,01 --> 00:04:02,38
I was calling on the subject of just pulling us out of. And wires and they were getting on and we do not go to school.

42
00:04:03,32 --> 00:04:05,39
I just think that the power was off but I got us all.

43
00:04:06,4 --> 00:04:11,03
They don't let any of the alleged because I don't need I doing that I didn't have any you know connection

44
00:04:11,03 --> 00:04:15,46
and it's if you've started I hardly have any knowledge of clinics and components.

45
00:04:15,91 --> 00:04:21,41
So I wonder why I go to school then you're going to be less dead. Again that that was a capital which wards.

46
00:04:21,59 --> 00:04:27,13
And most of course enough for me to. Practically go to to do the experience I mean to do that only.

47
00:04:28,23 --> 00:04:34,02
So I'm wondering and I just got completely lost in that sort of good I was completely excited.

48
00:04:35,06 --> 00:04:39,48
It was going to get better than it was there's little in the esophagus and everything is completely in love

49
00:04:39,48 --> 00:04:47,05
and death then stopped a few minutes I heard a beep so I just did what I was doing just to pollute

50
00:04:48,09 --> 00:04:55,98
and I so much better without lifting a single dime I just bag on the suckers and on the West. I suppose it's possible.

51
00:04:56,38 --> 00:05:04,6
I just read the blogs like in the school you jump to the Baird holding the book upside down and bed and screaming.

52
00:05:06,99 --> 00:05:12,91
Then my father something is not come on something not of this might be it has done.

53
00:05:15,39 --> 00:05:17,87
I just see the he's putting the book upside down

54
00:05:17,87 --> 00:05:24,09
and something not to this activity has done let's see what he has done to my father just for being able to ask for the

55
00:05:24,09 --> 00:05:29,41
note because that was a I don't need it. Night. I don't bear. They don't been B.M. Even say so.

56
00:05:29,57 --> 00:05:38,58
My mom did not let out of one down once the sauce was hideous because Indians of more than two bellies full ten don't

57
00:05:38,58 --> 00:05:44,17
you know madam what it would be nice Well General My mom can skew the numbers game skewed at what's in that size was he.

58
00:05:44,17 --> 00:05:51,89
It's that he adds. So fast that. So my mom just relaxed on her bared about on the blog up the T.V.

59
00:05:52,7 --> 00:06:01,48
Remote distances of space to work on the one going off when. House was on fire.

60
00:06:03,3 --> 00:06:10,66
All my neighbors only if you let me bring in the sand. That's when I was and yes I did it. I am the scientist.

61
00:06:10,71 --> 00:06:15,35
Yes I did indeed I did it I just screamed like anything yes I did it.

62
00:06:15,41 --> 00:06:22,67
I'm the scientist because that they made in knowledge that the person who does something oppressing something in it.

63
00:06:22,69 --> 00:06:26,65
Blushed. Then he got a scientist I know that God was the meaning of a scientist.

64
00:06:26,71 --> 00:06:30,92
When I was a kid so I was screaming like anything and then all my bad

65
00:06:30,92 --> 00:06:36,38
and thought of my relatives all of the neighbors the came to me I thought dead coming to upload me what I have done

66
00:06:36,38 --> 00:06:41,02
but that outlawed once in such a way that my stomach was completely filled with.

67
00:06:43,12 --> 00:06:48,6
All the schoolings all those Gleamings why don't they can do so in my you do was completely done better

68
00:06:50,44 --> 00:06:54,04
and from that Bill No Once I was here I'll be a problem.

69
00:06:54,17 --> 00:07:04,41
All those look get there's everything even not love after a few days even if you come from in neighborhoods any of the

70
00:07:04,41 --> 00:07:07,31
neighboring homes and so you wouldn't believe I'm saying go to India when they want us out

71
00:07:07,31 --> 00:07:11,21
and say sun is coming to your home and they will fast. Site and people.

72
00:07:11,25 --> 00:07:13,47
I said that get their stand on the new list of sins on this coming.

73
00:07:13,66 --> 00:07:22,61
It's either going to have any of the good some legs gotta have it from me so that was like that when I was in my club.

74
00:07:22,76 --> 00:07:23,39
So I could. My best.

75
00:07:23,46 --> 00:07:30,34
I'm glad technology or not but when you see gradually my passion towards innovation happened by accident.

76
00:07:30,86 --> 00:07:36,89
You can see because I never thought I would make it universal I was fascinated and I was special because you get there.

77
00:07:36,94 --> 00:07:40,65
But that doesn't mean that Universal Music accident.

78
00:07:40,67 --> 00:07:49,83
And that happens in a way that when I was in my dance tonight when I was sixteen years old I had gone to hospital.

79
00:07:49,85 --> 00:07:52,92
With my father I mean my father generally used to have a hybrid person

80
00:07:52,92 --> 00:07:59,86
and he goes What are we to take up so one day just like a man and he went to the hospital and with a husband.

81
00:08:00,21 --> 00:08:08,16
It's a small hospital consent clinic and my father just entered into doctor's care and I had I would I would say.

82
00:08:08,21 --> 00:08:13,9
So when up to those few minutes I saw that my eyes are so outward I mean just got back in

83
00:08:14,59 --> 00:08:20,46
or lids disabled person because of the or it is his hands and then we'll come to this to prevent that.

84
00:08:20,49 --> 00:08:22,09
By this might have happened or that.

85
00:08:22,72 --> 00:08:28,97
So I was seeing that he was sitting in a wheelchair then and he would have been assisted by

86
00:08:28,97 --> 00:08:34,85
and also the day the wound of the play was of them meaning what was happening.

87
00:08:34,86 --> 00:08:40,66
I just found out the puzzle of notable to speak because they came to know that seventy percent of the disease would

88
00:08:40,66 --> 00:08:42,24
pull the news of the Congo out because of the

89
00:08:42,24 --> 00:08:50,00
but a lot of this is so deeply spiraling to the little spinal activeness it is the I mean these activities have been so

90
00:08:50,00 --> 00:08:57,00
I saw that he would not I would do express want to get the ones who are slightly able to visit hands

91
00:08:57,00 --> 00:09:01,76
but not exactly able to express what they're going to let me say as you know they were the experts.

92
00:09:02,26 --> 00:09:05,55
So when it was your business to handle a nonstarter.

93
00:09:06,13 --> 00:09:10,14
You might and might I mean you need liquid water and something so handed over to him of less importance

94
00:09:11,49 --> 00:09:16,37
and he just threw down. I mean you want something and so we're seeing their situation a deity Huntsman.

95
00:09:16,44 --> 00:09:23,05
I just failed to get my myself in that position that if someone's was brain was about everything looking more due to

96
00:09:23,05 --> 00:09:27,33
the goodness on the middle of the destruction of them

97
00:09:27,33 --> 00:09:34,89
and so the inaudible to speak express how painful that's just me I don't I just told Dr life so it really was then that

98
00:09:37,44 --> 00:09:45,4
so that flashed on my very emotional and a guy my soul learn how painfully then using that if I am I to do

99
00:09:46,95 --> 00:09:54,46
and I would then life even one person I would feel more leverage and I was happy and I was satisfied.

100
00:09:54,48 --> 00:09:59,14
I've empowered one person that I have brought him back in that life.

101
00:10:00,07 --> 00:10:02,57
I just want to live even one person that I would be more than happy.

102
00:10:04,16 --> 00:10:11,06
So I just came back to my home and people that what can I do so that they can do everything like not one who wins.

103
00:10:12,75 --> 00:10:15,91
So I just kept thinking and thinking

104
00:10:15,91 --> 00:10:21,91
and then finally come to a conclusion that the going to do something I will have to figure out what's the common thing

105
00:10:21,91 --> 00:10:33,27
we do not want to disable person I found the brain is gone but only if it is not that user friendly.

106
00:10:35,64 --> 00:10:40,96
I have a bond of love with the boss and was and will be using that in the essential properties on

107
00:10:40,96 --> 00:10:49,63
but in multiple teams. It's been if you look at those what we don't act we we I love about a voice or a hand like the.

108
00:10:49,82 --> 00:10:51,12
I want to move my hand in this way.

109
00:10:52,81 --> 00:10:59,43
To move the hand in this room and I come on with handle in this way poorly for different. So that is the control.

110
00:11:01,03 --> 00:11:06,1
So the next interesting thing that I just put out a poem which is called one and we did not get a list which is common.

111
00:11:06,22 --> 00:11:09,65
That is bleeding. You know distance becomes on gum on the bottom.

112
00:11:09,67 --> 00:11:13,97
This is an unknown one or the building is the one million which is common

113
00:11:13,97 --> 00:11:17,58
and which is what proponents wouldn't want a man and a disabled person

114
00:11:19,57 --> 00:11:25,5
and there's a big thing we're going to confront not our good the employer submitting the name in winter to get that

115
00:11:25,5 --> 00:11:33,59
but it more than an order taken on you can see a small guy that can want to but it being in a magnetic inputs

116
00:11:36,33 --> 00:11:41,75
and it does in this altered would this act as a single speech do multiple street jumps in

117
00:11:42,65 --> 00:11:50,07
and then we also invent the options with people screaming that to make great women on top of electrical appliances so

118
00:11:50,07 --> 00:11:59,28
it makes Mrs schooling which on the bus on one trip to work that option will get activated for two second group which

119
00:11:59,28 --> 00:12:01,35
can then begin to. Change.

120
00:12:02,04 --> 00:12:09,52
When he wants that option would like to get an opportunity if he would and the egg and option would keep him schooling.

121
00:12:11,81 --> 00:12:13,68
So it would be in a simplified

122
00:12:13,68 --> 00:12:17,42
when you know it is not something that can make something complicated such proof of something complicated.

123
00:12:17,66 --> 00:12:23,26
It's all about how seem pretty simply what it will solve that problem that encumbered program.

124
00:12:23,36 --> 00:12:29,03
So it seems we've heard some of them is always a great innovation. But I think so.

125
00:12:29,04 --> 00:12:31,03
In this way it is in the US enough

126
00:12:31,03 --> 00:12:37,76
and I have been near the bus on the disabled person which if he did it was a physically assisted device for the

127
00:12:37,76 --> 00:12:44,63
disabled person pull him by one of them to a group they would like humans to be getting the wheel to make operating on

128
00:12:44,63 --> 00:12:50,33
the elliptical appliances text messages in a space energy and cell phone and so many other activities.

129
00:12:52,48 --> 00:13:00,47
You know that was your first invention the bird started. No more to come off.

130
00:13:01,21 --> 00:13:07,38
Then we have up to this making you know listen I go I got my second place enough into a lot for these innocent

131
00:13:08,4 --> 00:13:10,9
and productive.

132
00:13:10,92 --> 00:13:13,09
And there are lots of media over this

133
00:13:13,09 --> 00:13:18,06
and not everything up in all of a sudden up to making this you know was on like it featured in the many magazines

134
00:13:18,06 --> 00:13:23,56
needles and I was lucky in that fame and all and I'm getting that bloody up resistance from each

135
00:13:23,56 --> 00:13:25,39
and every one I would like what happened.

136
00:13:25,63 --> 00:13:29,74
All of a sudden I was living in a lot more life on how this happened under Saddam.

137
00:13:30,67 --> 00:13:33,49
But in the glory in it and on one thing only the when he did it.

138
00:13:34,91 --> 00:13:39,01
This is not only innocent and that I realized

139
00:13:39,01 --> 00:13:43,1
when I was doing pilot testing on one of the disabled person went to jail

140
00:13:43,1 --> 00:13:51,34
but it was huge huge I mean the pilot doesn't have a device. He's just an additional how what I had in sugar.

141
00:13:51,47 --> 00:13:59,86
I just gave up and he just to bring He just never going to finish it. And right and stopped and the need to.

142
00:14:00,07 --> 00:14:06,71
Doctrine and act with the blood and soul the TS was falling from a day's work

143
00:14:06,72 --> 00:14:11,18
and I realized that that was not the sort of the tears of joy

144
00:14:12,16 --> 00:14:15,29
and looking that I started my from my altar tears came over

145
00:14:15,29 --> 00:14:20,7
and I have that study of success which I am I to be this is the day of success.

146
00:14:21,73 --> 00:14:22,69
I needed that you know was

147
00:14:22,69 --> 00:14:29,47
and is being used by the not a good person from who for whom I have never been you know wisdom.

148
00:14:30,73 --> 00:14:37,65
So if I am able to gain by what one does all of us on life then my you know some point

149
00:14:37,65 --> 00:14:39,09
but it was all making sense from food.

150
00:14:39,13 --> 00:14:47,42
So if I can name one person like that I can buy one million suddenly them then we can i mean.

151
00:14:48,1 --> 00:14:51,1
It was just brought to market by I want a war not in the fall.

152
00:14:51,1 --> 00:14:57,01
I'm absolutely sure not all of us are not I that we can license to any letter with a laser disembody come to the

153
00:14:57,01 --> 00:14:59,2
universe on its own made in medical device.

154
00:14:59,32 --> 00:15:04,83
So it's better that we should license this in a was and when you might become one who can properly man fix it.

155
00:15:05,11 --> 00:15:11,82
I dare add to that finished product level they can manufacture in that level so that if a digital person can get the

156
00:15:11,82 --> 00:15:12,98
maximum benefit of the free.

157
00:15:13,78 --> 00:15:17,15
So I participate or not will listen to any metric company

158
00:15:17,15 --> 00:15:22,12
and we are in process to do that because we don't want to come much later this innovation because it is going to end by

159
00:15:22,12 --> 00:15:30,38
one million so be able to parlay so is a bit of what already established in that in this movie. Biotechnology.

160
00:15:31,17 --> 00:15:35,33
Medical technology industries out here in this we will

161
00:15:35,33 --> 00:15:42,55
but I seem to get labeled I thought that it should be these people who can make it to put world global public

162
00:15:42,55 --> 00:15:45,81
and whom I love in that label with that finishing with that.

163
00:15:47,22 --> 00:15:53,11
And with that vision they can just make it which do a good that normally would and I didn't

164
00:15:53,11 --> 00:15:59,62
and second because I was off now we are focusing them songs on the universe and on woman safety where they will send.

165
00:16:00,07 --> 00:16:05,24
Also it's better that not before us on WANT to believe. Yes just to focus on one day they'll meet with it.

166
00:16:05,25 --> 00:16:11,4
We can give our best. So I thought that I mean many people who can give their best in these days every day.

167
00:16:11,45 --> 00:16:15,61
Don't want to add to that a lot. I want to get in and begin for that.

168
00:16:15,63 --> 00:16:25,07
So in this way we have to do their day will impact. This fiber quite a feat for twenty four year old. Some of the.

169
00:16:25,59 --> 00:16:33,25
What I thought when I was in Section household. To draw for and why do you think it's so unique.

170
00:16:33,27 --> 00:16:43,28
What you're doing see because I didn't I didn't know isn't what I find I that it existed in that perfect solution for

171
00:16:43,28 --> 00:16:50,03
to solve that and government programs for everything and that is the solution but that is not a simplified solution.

172
00:16:50,94 --> 00:16:55,64
I thought visibility we have that's grown that Deeks or the simplified which are sort of.

173
00:16:57,07 --> 00:17:01,55
There's so many innovations out there but I feel that whether it is even the problem

174
00:17:01,55 --> 00:17:08,03
and none of those I'm going to solve hundred much of them but how with what ha.

175
00:17:08,35 --> 00:17:12,95
Bob how much security and how much probability of solving the problem dogmatists

176
00:17:12,95 --> 00:17:18,85
and how many how much percent of the problems is being sold that matters if there is enormous

177
00:17:18,85 --> 00:17:23,71
and we shall take people to know the problem if I mean it was just something ninety percent of the problem in that you

178
00:17:23,71 --> 00:17:29,67
know some sort of it and when I found I just saw you post something on the Internet

179
00:17:29,67 --> 00:17:36,34
and all the many other ways like I saw side plaster would do this market something where that it's kind of innocent is

180
00:17:36,34 --> 00:17:41,39
dead or not any particular solution is the I don't know if I find that there is no such

181
00:17:42,25 --> 00:17:46,78
but it was a solution not a good solution not a perfect solution for any of those sites

182
00:17:46,78 --> 00:17:48,43
and counter problem the one thing that.

183
00:17:48,47 --> 00:17:54,4
So you know isn't hard but we don't I don't buy value adding to the existing universes or book get a new Windows

184
00:17:54,4 --> 00:18:01,03
and if you just don't do the lesson. So this will reveal where reduces your. Go to produce.

185
00:18:01,58 --> 00:18:09,05
You see it's like this is the this illusion for an Indian problem. Or and it's for that reason that it works or is it.

186
00:18:09,37 --> 00:18:12,01
Yeah it's factored fall because of looking in the name problem

187
00:18:12,01 --> 00:18:18,83
but finally I found out it's not only an initial There's a bloke over them like you if you say it's a global record

188
00:18:18,83 --> 00:18:25,88
U.S. Is Indian number one in the number of threads started by tax every day and every year.

189
00:18:26,03 --> 00:18:32,11
Second comes but I didn't touch comes in India not in the number of labor tax every day.

190
00:18:32,22 --> 00:18:36,59
That's what the current printing ideal in India comes number one because

191
00:18:37,35 --> 00:18:41,31
but I don't know what happened since Google to that in getting some of it. Of our taxes.

192
00:18:41,43 --> 00:18:45,63
The best to go in causing and there is no button and solution options.

193
00:18:46,04 --> 00:18:52,22
Were the first to put a force on them to call this policy I want to get with what things are someone

194
00:18:52,22 --> 00:18:53,05
or something is missing.

195
00:18:55,07 --> 00:18:57,84
A little bit of some solutions like theirs or guns people strange

196
00:18:57,84 --> 00:19:04,96
but that's me on is not who is who does that I protest because then I would try to understand the psychology of human

197
00:19:04,96 --> 00:19:05,11
why.

198
00:19:05,81 --> 00:19:09,62
I mean people are not using the existing you know sense of progress which is dead in the market

199
00:19:10,59 --> 00:19:15,81
and one thing that to stopping them to use that is a style shipment in their on that train the dogs are not class

200
00:19:15,81 --> 00:19:20,26
and I would like if that was you people think that white people to preserve their life.

201
00:19:20,35 --> 00:19:24,38
I mean I was going to read them and it happens to all of us.

202
00:19:24,42 --> 00:19:26,59
I don't at any just some so

203
00:19:27,56 --> 00:19:31,75
and psychology did that there is a problem that a lot things that are considered over gone

204
00:19:31,75 --> 00:19:35,09
when I was in that locking them up and you just ignore them. Well OK helmet.

205
00:19:35,7 --> 00:19:40,45
People hardly would helmet but to save them from getting fined in any police gets them then.

206
00:19:40,63 --> 00:19:45,46
That's why they're wearing helmets that thing that we feel we were not we are not this accident.

207
00:19:45,66 --> 00:19:53,78
No nor wanting for the worst thing we just wind up in so they are just how confident and nothing is going to happen

208
00:19:55,07 --> 00:20:00,02
and that's where they're going to take people's priorities are guns but what about the possible eat. You know.

209
00:20:00,07 --> 00:20:05,22
Most have been done to do study by tax and second though they're not any kind of statistician.

210
00:20:06,42 --> 00:20:14,16
I mean that both are not questionable and and Targum is that those kind of those are not winnable.

211
00:20:15,14 --> 00:20:18,68
And actually that can be misused that easily.

212
00:20:18,75 --> 00:20:24,15
If the person was using the people to create the gun was you using the people spray against actor that you can stand

213
00:20:24,15 --> 00:20:31,52
the People's Bank and used against him and then again at the end of the same for the president and any of the gadgets.

214
00:20:32,53 --> 00:20:41,22
So fasting we fall needed to do whatever it can to be snatched must last you would if you could I could not say that it

215
00:20:41,23 --> 00:20:41,6
can witness

216
00:20:41,6 --> 00:20:48,28
but it will be if you go down something which is it was between which is not whether we were able to assist difficult

217
00:20:48,28 --> 00:20:50,2
stance. Now would there.

218
00:20:50,31 --> 00:20:57,7
What to be done with a neutral that it would be too difficult to snatch as well because obviously we've become better

219
00:20:57,7 --> 00:21:05,25
between a man and a woman we men is a more safe if you go to strong and in confidence phrase and in many factors

220
00:21:06,02 --> 00:21:15,00
but we have to empower the women of girls by giving some value out in the public gadget or something. So we told her.

221
00:21:15,1 --> 00:21:20,93
Let's improve on small Michael who don't know who don't which we know one of those are going to try to temper that if

222
00:21:20,93 --> 00:21:26,77
they don't want to because it's us which is quite enough that one someone's hand if someone tries to grab the gadget

223
00:21:27,49 --> 00:21:29,55
or grab any part of the hand

224
00:21:29,55 --> 00:21:33,49
or somewhere just the guy going to just make that gadget contact with any part of the screen

225
00:21:33,49 --> 00:21:38,42
and you get a severe pain and it would retain the mindset of the attacker.

226
00:21:38,47 --> 00:21:43,69
If you get a few up and panicking that back of that you should look for that I think and

227
00:21:43,7 --> 00:21:47,95
and that should be used at the last moment before that will include depending

228
00:21:47,95 --> 00:21:54,49
but I'm just replacing one bending more than one like a siren will get activated which is you don't want to do want to

229
00:21:54,49 --> 00:21:59,93
disable some frequency which is equal to the mall. I mean ambulance and police said I was going to get into your.

230
00:22:00,07 --> 00:22:07,23
Your disposal and you could create havoc in the environment and you could get a few in the.

231
00:22:07,25 --> 00:22:12,09
Keep that if you're in back in that article and at the same pain call

232
00:22:12,09 --> 00:22:16,92
and it will go to the registered numbers like ten million additional months and as soon as Enter Google

233
00:22:16,92 --> 00:22:21,66
and then one hundred will go to the nearest police station or to the nearest corpse

234
00:22:22,93 --> 00:22:25,99
and in this way in this shift if you just asked when does

235
00:22:25,99 --> 00:22:30,41
and what do we know there were only this using this putting deceptive it just where it will.

236
00:22:30,47 --> 00:22:38,21
It's not going great and I mean that it. Got boat builder dot dot dot about it. WOMAN one does.

237
00:22:38,55 --> 00:22:42,32
I mean that's how we are developing for women for girls.

238
00:22:42,33 --> 00:22:52,92
Fashion is a fashion statement will you know what are we design it does like a smart safety smart safety fitness watch.

239
00:22:52,94 --> 00:22:53,41
Yes.

240
00:22:53,43 --> 00:23:00,72
And finally we send or like in the form of a digital watch your digital watch we witness and present future pictures

241
00:23:00,72 --> 00:23:08,58
and human safety features that people will wear just like you whether we're like I'd like to put this what if any kind

242
00:23:08,58 --> 00:23:14,34
of I think when they can use them. So PETER SAGAL So you're pushing this brought in that in the government.

243
00:23:15,44 --> 00:23:24,42
It's like you find you farmed almost the mission I'm in the market to corner the market that hasn't been covered by

244
00:23:24,42 --> 00:23:24,81
others.

245
00:23:24,94 --> 00:23:30,82
Yes because it has it has not because of bottom part of the sea that up witness was there some Best better

246
00:23:30,82 --> 00:23:34,65
and better fitness was in the room that in many secret defeaters

247
00:23:34,65 --> 00:23:44,51
but all in the one where there was not I wouldn't say everything is there. But however seemed like. When you make food.

248
00:23:44,64 --> 00:23:51,52
You have the doubles and all but the least you make is innovative so how you collect vegetables and all

249
00:23:51,52 --> 00:24:00,02
and now we make you feel that much of the finally how you use the. I mean. To leave.

250
00:24:01,06 --> 00:24:04,67
People the spices and all that wonders how wonderful

251
00:24:04,67 --> 00:24:10,41
and how you know do you made the from because every like I did they will turn small to I

252
00:24:10,41 --> 00:24:16,16
but I will anyway so say me in guessable this gadget or not. So if you.

253
00:24:16,19 --> 00:24:20,97
I we part and party to individual features the features would be I really would have been

254
00:24:22,19 --> 00:24:29,61
but how do you know what they really were designed how like how it would be consumed how if it would one of what would

255
00:24:29,61 --> 00:24:30,03
be a sequence

256
00:24:30,03 --> 00:24:37,61
and whole what it is user friendly that might just sold this is the one we would look where we you know what to make it

257
00:24:37,61 --> 00:24:44,11
a user friendly solution. How I mean what they're going to want like the woman and guns can properly use disguise it.

258
00:24:44,2 --> 00:24:52,31
So it's kind of smooth then shall judgement. All in one. If I say no we're done. While it's if I say no. We'll need.

259
00:24:52,32 --> 00:24:58,61
Fitness watch with safety features an all in one. You know what it will is I didn't find anyone.

260
00:24:58,84 --> 00:25:01,07
That's why you would give a biscuit

261
00:25:01,07 --> 00:25:08,91
and where you get your knowledge from I mean what what you see it all about it being what you've been saying here

262
00:25:08,92 --> 00:25:18,35
and I am good in generalising the what I am an innovator. I so I've found a problem. I found. And then I.

263
00:25:19,24 --> 00:25:22,05
Tried to I did a proper solution to tears.

264
00:25:22,08 --> 00:25:26,19
I mean I did that you can see I saw that is a problem is encountered problems

265
00:25:26,19 --> 00:25:34,63
and to dis universal to to this a good idea to discuss you know lessons in this problem is going to solve this is just

266
00:25:34,63 --> 00:25:40,19
the idea that the concept that not all concept every idea actually thought that this is going to put a solution to the

267
00:25:40,19 --> 00:25:47,28
problem then we do the market. Sort of in that way. That's the kind of. What about the maximum bet of.

268
00:25:47,5 --> 00:25:56,26
The device which is I would the first time I'd love to solve the tax but we found that a not so great

269
00:25:56,27 --> 00:26:00,03
when I was on the not so great. Gadgets which can actually solve the problem.

270
00:26:01,33 --> 00:26:06,88
And then we told her we have to finally be sent something. Now I got to do it and everything.

271
00:26:07,77 --> 00:26:12,84
It's obvious because I have knowledge in aversion and all but and I have the knowledge and technology as well

272
00:26:12,84 --> 00:26:16,77
but by doing everything all in and I don't need medical difficult chore.

273
00:26:17,04 --> 00:26:22,38
I didn't approach but what's going to make it a product. There's a question.

274
00:26:23,63 --> 00:26:24,98
So now I generalized the what

275
00:26:24,98 --> 00:26:32,39
but one would thing in me that I know I have the knowledge that which what has to be done not which place where the

276
00:26:32,39 --> 00:26:38,17
right people the people who can do it if it be really where they are have at I believe when currently.

277
00:26:38,47 --> 00:26:41,49
I have that knowledge I have that due to my experience

278
00:26:41,49 --> 00:27:00,26
or due to my exposure to Bob while maybe that then has him going to be a game engine me but due to this. Sure.

279
00:27:01,35 --> 00:27:16,00
Current solution for election is us. Yeah yeah. Yes yes. So yeah yeah I was saying this whole.

280
00:27:16,02 --> 00:27:23,13
Finally I don't know what the right people would have read that I'm a liberal who would be able to blow a boob were

281
00:27:23,13 --> 00:27:26,17
putting it up to me like some will be doing a good design.

282
00:27:26,42 --> 00:27:32,98
So I foundered I have a critic being one of their designers in order to be a nurse who can act best. Who are full.

283
00:27:33,07 --> 00:27:39,57
So I want to create a team to get Eleanor and like minded or go to that end of the room.

284
00:27:40,49 --> 00:27:41,75
Then I keep on channeling the things.

285
00:27:42,08 --> 00:27:50,54
Who would but will be in a better way then I try to combine everything will slot on my including my ideas

286
00:27:50,54 --> 00:27:56,92
and universe and then what I can implement if I have done this and everyone down nuclear does most complete beam

287
00:27:56,92 --> 00:27:59,31
and combine to make it one product.

288
00:28:00,07 --> 00:28:02,43
So that finally it can get him back

289
00:28:03,43 --> 00:28:10,9
and that's what you're saying is that you have a lot of I do years inventions you make it you take one mountain

290
00:28:10,9 --> 00:28:12,39
and commercialize it but

291
00:28:12,39 --> 00:28:18,46
when you look at the other inventions what were what kind of ideas started where you were sixty a part of them will

292
00:28:18,46 --> 00:28:20,34
transcend this is this is more.

293
00:28:20,94 --> 00:28:27,64
That I realized that film was everything all emotion all of a sudden it's very difficult to pick up the any of the Big

294
00:28:27,64 --> 00:28:30,15
Sur companies like Apple and Microsoft.

295
00:28:30,16 --> 00:28:32,9
You see the game the market of the one person

296
00:28:33,83 --> 00:28:40,72
when the one for you can become heat success then the game with the other perhaps even with that one going to keep an

297
00:28:40,72 --> 00:28:44,07
eye opening that one perhaps used to conclude up a lot of Microsoft

298
00:28:44,07 --> 00:28:48,17
or anyone who does it with they have in one part of the focus of the one program

299
00:28:48,17 --> 00:28:55,08
and bozo school for most of the one product and then the one who is creating millions and millions of impact.

300
00:28:55,09 --> 00:29:02,59
So I was particular that if I only create the impact at a global level I felt for most of the one point zero if that is

301
00:29:02,59 --> 00:29:11,09
because everybody nation will be a part of your part of the it was as I have done so far I am looking that I will with

302
00:29:11,09 --> 00:29:15,95
bio tech but related to any of the combinations the universities

303
00:29:15,95 --> 00:29:21,16
and again I want to the venue what I can do that you know and I will do it to be licensed by any of the type

304
00:29:21,16 --> 00:29:27,06
or to go on a sun audit with the collaboration wheat. So modernizing that we can add some.

305
00:29:28,83 --> 00:29:34,99
Unit we can add some value or to that program and they can or the low side vendor to the bar and we jointly we can.

306
00:29:37,04 --> 00:29:41,44
Call them that in the joint. For the call much later.

307
00:29:41,49 --> 00:29:45,25
Not by licensing unpredictable type but they are going to some in this way

308
00:29:45,25 --> 00:29:48,05
or that in the innovation is going to get into the market

309
00:29:48,05 --> 00:29:53,95
and that would create impact if I was in that from my other than a set up from my own company.

310
00:29:54,21 --> 00:29:59,8
I am going to push is very difficult and that is everything will go to get dished up.

311
00:30:00,23 --> 00:30:07,13
I understand that but that's a lot of people who have these ideas. Why is it that you were awarded so many awards.

312
00:30:07,71 --> 00:30:10,72
And the way I visualize and imagine a particular problem

313
00:30:10,72 --> 00:30:18,84
and I've found it effective solution for that it's all about we let you know listen is going to solve the problem

314
00:30:18,84 --> 00:30:24,75
and how soon be paid to universities how innovative the idea is if you dig everything into the gun to do this

315
00:30:24,75 --> 00:30:34,54
and that's where it's being. I wondered by the butts enough in the that I want to conceal what I want to fly so.

316
00:30:36,2 --> 00:30:44,06
So that you know diminishment just like the house at the young age House simplified I began to assume that I would have

317
00:30:44,06 --> 00:30:50,97
done with more in a computer minus. It's all about to seem very innocent gets a great sense. That's why we're bored.

318
00:30:51,15 --> 00:30:56,46
Yeah you could say. And do you agree with that because you were awarded.

319
00:30:56,48 --> 00:30:58,81
You know because not fasting I'm going up

320
00:30:58,81 --> 00:31:03,14
and the big I was thinking that there are many more great you know what does that on many more universal.

321
00:31:03,17 --> 00:31:07,23
I mean gadgets which other far complicated and then my innovations.

322
00:31:07,46 --> 00:31:13,88
But why are I what I want it and obviously the people who get I want to do it wouldn't lot of talent to do the memos

323
00:31:13,88 --> 00:31:18,55
and all that who they should give the body the clues mean

324
00:31:18,55 --> 00:31:25,43
and I will do the something in a sense something that MS they have found that you know listen then I mean.

325
00:31:25,45 --> 00:31:32,23
Then they don't come Dame out from someone I came to know that is is me I want to because how simply the problem is

326
00:31:32,23 --> 00:31:37,67
being solved and that they get it if you know how you do differently the universities and those universes.

327
00:31:38,08 --> 00:31:45,18
Yes I want to because that is W. No sense that going that he would cook I mean the kind of scenario.

328
00:31:45,2 --> 00:31:47,11
And it's not about oil.

329
00:31:47,11 --> 00:31:52,68
It was a computer know sort of simplifying a listen and be able to tell me

330
00:31:52,68 --> 00:31:57,18
and explain a bit more of the innovations you you were awarded for you have the wheelchair

331
00:31:57,18 --> 00:32:04,56
and you have the work of our innovation. Your invention. Yes. Well be able to design a low cost.

332
00:32:04,73 --> 00:32:11,61
Electricity is just dumb like you would a great efficiency molest a little input and a great great represents a lot.

333
00:32:11,62 --> 00:32:16,91
So it's going to in the near what what we have value add to that in the most news that only a few primitives site

334
00:32:16,91 --> 00:32:22,45
enough to build on the back to can be kept in a cycle Cadia only programmer cycling going to noone can get in there

335
00:32:22,45 --> 00:32:24,97
don't let the shooting.

336
00:32:26,12 --> 00:32:33,04
So that you know what you miss we did is that telling that we have overcome by admitting that you know us

337
00:32:33,04 --> 00:32:38,13
and that same as you and with which we do so for such kind of there's a gadget.

338
00:32:38,34 --> 00:32:44,87
Now there are many better that actually are doing those days since Piper six are stable like we did to get there to

339
00:32:44,87 --> 00:32:49,37
where we can all put it on the computer and laptop applications without using in keyboard

340
00:32:49,37 --> 00:32:55,74
and most of the computer you want on most to transport we're near we'll get it just like we just act everything in the

341
00:32:55,74 --> 00:32:59,75
air and. Add.

342
00:33:00,99 --> 00:33:07,27
On the companies feel like I would be a killer doctor that clearly I would make I can do everything and do so

343
00:33:07,27 --> 00:33:08,83
and that I was able to do.

344
00:33:08,93 --> 00:33:15,52
No one was a weird look but it was not the universe I'm on now in that I do not need you know some scheme.

345
00:33:16,39 --> 00:33:24,41
So in this way that a lot of the you know since like one brainless cute like them because we know that that message

346
00:33:24,42 --> 00:33:28,66
also no doubt about the cost and design. It's one.

347
00:33:29,82 --> 00:33:33,73
If you pull one some more designs of the god or something they can or get it.

348
00:33:33,76 --> 00:33:37,96
I was the girl I was there but but it is there by that particular god

349
00:33:39,11 --> 00:33:46,91
and it is difficult that if the vision is to reduce world accidents which of his own is to reduce traffic jams and all.

350
00:33:47,09 --> 00:33:49,75
So even if we have to be the Davis.

351
00:33:50,00 --> 00:33:53,79
It's not only wonder who they can get but I list is not possible when everyone can

352
00:33:53,79 --> 00:33:59,99
or afford to have it in one cannot expense that in their driver.

353
00:34:00,07 --> 00:34:07,18
Everyone will not sell their own got to get their Davis Cup so we are putting each and every one. So what.

354
00:34:07,25 --> 00:34:07,63
Like I don't.

355
00:34:07,92 --> 00:34:13,22
It could get would be then which can be implemented you need to enable to make it even this last week

356
00:34:13,22 --> 00:34:17,34
and even if someone is within your local to make a living that can be the keep going to be one in from the low

357
00:34:17,34 --> 00:34:23,17
but hey can we show that is more than millions and those make it.

358
00:34:23,18 --> 00:34:27,02
We're going to do or Davis into making a better Scotland and make it good then

359
00:34:27,02 --> 00:34:32,66
and we can make it out of this one so that is when we will listen to the more mobility industries.

360
00:34:33,14 --> 00:34:37,17
And what your role in that will be done and design the cute.

361
00:34:37,28 --> 00:34:45,34
So we're looking that we can license to any type of automobile industry so that they can get in the market we don't

362
00:34:45,34 --> 00:34:51,53
want will cost less does you know us and what makes you want. What makes it Indian what you're doing.

363
00:34:51,7 --> 00:34:53,04
It's so specific that.

364
00:34:53,35 --> 00:34:56,86
You have to go see in the only not more traffic jams

365
00:34:56,86 --> 00:35:04,34
and the number up in causing a lot of road accident is more as compared to the. Other developed countries.

366
00:35:04,63 --> 00:35:06,18
You know zero management

367
00:35:06,18 --> 00:35:12,91
and one is that really getting caught up on what are the potential areal you can see the profit down ten dollars is a

368
00:35:12,91 --> 00:35:19,08
matter of concern so to solve that I feel that it's good to get insured we need to name the bacon.

369
00:35:20,11 --> 00:35:25,85
It's really what you see in your daily life in India is you're trying to focus on what I was.

370
00:35:25,86 --> 00:35:32,62
But what I do when I'm in winning something I'm looking at the global aspect how did in global You did it is

371
00:35:32,62 --> 00:35:39,39
when we came back and it all the people start from one place. So I've been in India and I'm looking at how fast I will.

372
00:35:39,55 --> 00:35:46,85
There was no I don't get the impact in India then. The same thing I can replicate book back.

373
00:35:46,92 --> 00:35:49,54
And on the Hill because everyone is a human human being

374
00:35:49,54 --> 00:35:56,7
and I believe that human humanity matters in what way is meditation helping you to find solutions.

375
00:35:56,72 --> 00:35:59,97
Now obviously because I'm labelled a teen there beyond me in my.

376
00:36:00,07 --> 00:36:05,5
Innocent in up that level that what kind of you know sin is going to solve the problem.

377
00:36:05,51 --> 00:36:07,07
It's not a not one might it won't work.

378
00:36:07,95 --> 00:36:15,45
So dot com is that extra that power is required to clean different protein that is unique.

379
00:36:15,82 --> 00:36:21,44
So I feel that because of that I'm able to team beyond my imagination.

380
00:36:21,46 --> 00:36:27,26
We have beyond our capacity we may be different from people to people but I feel that that helps me

381
00:36:27,26 --> 00:36:33,82
or drives me to you know what something really what's happening where your military career explaining what's what's

382
00:36:33,82 --> 00:36:37,63
going on in your head when I see. I'm able to feel a stone next five.

383
00:36:37,7 --> 00:36:44,03
I will I will be able to visualize movies and let me visit I like I would be delusional in Baghdad.

384
00:36:44,69 --> 00:36:53,21
Fifty million users swallowed way in the next five years so I'm able to visualize Denmark what how we are going in.

385
00:36:53,3 --> 00:36:56,14
We're going inside that sun all wrong. Like we should do next.

386
00:36:56,35 --> 00:37:02,38
And we will see that in a plan of a dream or in the form of a video but I want to see when I'm closing my eyes

387
00:37:02,38 --> 00:37:03,04
and I will see that.

388
00:37:03,15 --> 00:37:07,73
And yes but I want to we have to show now we have going in this direction or there is some problem

389
00:37:07,73 --> 00:37:11,89
and it was a simple dish that it's something that we should do the usual morning back.

390
00:37:11,95 --> 00:37:17,9
So I will do standup five years we've done what we don't know where we are standing right here.

391
00:37:18,02 --> 00:37:26,04
Boom or stand at this point. So how this can multiply all that impact we're creating from a million little billions.

392
00:37:26,26 --> 00:37:32,89
So how it can I just we were able to visualize that and we have difficulty of his them

393
00:37:32,89 --> 00:37:39,58
and we are sure that if you add to that vision in the next five years people even at even the heat.

394
00:37:39,69 --> 00:37:45,92
If you will it will do at least fifty percent of our vision if you. In the in the next five years.

395
00:37:46,48 --> 00:37:52,98
Then you can multiply it to billions in the next five or the next day and if you can if you want to lead.

396
00:37:53,00 --> 00:37:59,65
We are I mean ultimately going to pull them out of the studio tool that noise which we created it rip.

397
00:38:00,8 --> 00:38:02,3
If you are going to get more to play.

398
00:38:02,33 --> 00:38:07,62
So we don't need to enforce bull in bed billions if we can impact millions than are going to go.

399
00:38:07,63 --> 00:38:15,06
You do want to go to billions. You say visualize with what happens in your head explain the different steps.

400
00:38:15,27 --> 00:38:22,21
Yeah these three hours for human creation actually in a spiritually we have to look at us like I had on the help of

401
00:38:22,21 --> 00:38:28,00
people like you know like we have all the seven circles legs gets a little leg.

402
00:38:28,08 --> 00:38:35,08
We can stick it on but all in English and that and that and that is. It took us up toward this is to the heart.

403
00:38:35,14 --> 00:38:42,82
So you stuck close up and as I used you can see all these sickos when you where did some there's some actual

404
00:38:42,82 --> 00:38:49,24
and those in the universe. So when you met or did when you used like I'm actually you. I would.

405
00:38:49,55 --> 00:38:51,03
I don't want to nominate it was a month

406
00:38:51,03 --> 00:38:57,63
and he said he can one thing I do generally so in that I just grasp what the cost me going to do to my body

407
00:38:59,66 --> 00:39:05,65
and in that process obviously that you know that come into play here will do this last put

408
00:39:05,65 --> 00:39:13,81
and in the general a shuttle will outline what I'm an energy guest plus boarding the body then it's dished up if it

409
00:39:13,81 --> 00:39:16,05
will go and moment.

410
00:39:17,00 --> 00:39:24,59
So their energies that helps you build then that strength and that confidence that or whatever development of good

411
00:39:25,31 --> 00:39:30,21
and that confidence he has this is you can you can actually you'll get the power to pick the right decision

412
00:39:30,21 --> 00:39:35,5
and the right thing that's most important the people who are success brought to this scenario because of making the

413
00:39:35,5 --> 00:39:43,99
right decision of the right thing. So that things that you want it will get that confidence that the that I did.

414
00:39:44,36 --> 00:39:46,2
We're taking this is the right thing.

415
00:39:46,21 --> 00:39:53,95
Google the statement when I feel that it happens when that and then does anyone food believed what he did

416
00:39:53,95 --> 00:39:58,81
and there is this and that into the body for that. And yes you can feel that he.

417
00:40:00,07 --> 00:40:03,51
For doing properly and it's three hours a day.

418
00:40:03,62 --> 00:40:12,85
I don't go to one five hours you can see there are a lot of us through hard times I don't know what arguments

419
00:40:13,67 --> 00:40:14,29
and then you're completely.

420
00:40:15,51 --> 00:40:23,55
Yeah he gets your computer then I've let the progress in and out and and of these created I.D.'s I would.

421
00:40:23,55 --> 00:40:29,03
I'm going to do if I planned this I would give this that and my love

422
00:40:29,03 --> 00:40:36,21
and know that I my God that extra boost in center will move that with great force to achieve that vision

423
00:40:36,21 --> 00:40:43,9
and every day I'm doing something that live with that vision is one day is getting at you every day every day.

424
00:40:44,00 --> 00:40:53,08
Why I'm just putting a broad broad drop of of that before you feel that prism. Where you.

425
00:40:53,1 --> 00:40:58,00
And when you could explain that vision. WHAT THAT YOU HAVE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT IS IT.

426
00:40:59,15 --> 00:41:02,56
The vision you have where are you in five twenty years. Yeah.

427
00:41:02,74 --> 00:41:06,51
In the next five years we have just realizing bring back fifty million.

428
00:41:06,53 --> 00:41:10,54
I mean you just in the next five years and back to the fifty million users obviously

429
00:41:11,33 --> 00:41:14,37
and back to about E two in a list of US products.

430
00:41:14,58 --> 00:41:20,78
So we are now making the product in such a word that it is going to be in I mean that millions of people are going to

431
00:41:22,19 --> 00:41:27,42
buy this product they would like to feel that they had that some space settled by which your film made them feel that

432
00:41:27,42 --> 00:41:33,01
what I was that special. If that what this device so made to made them that freed.

433
00:41:33,22 --> 00:41:40,46
So we're just trying to create packaging in such a way that the people who just love to get this product will be

434
00:41:41,44 --> 00:41:44,73
getting this product. So we're doing that so.

435
00:41:45,73 --> 00:41:49,83
And we're going to couple of months we will do this and we will just put this product to market

436
00:41:51,3 --> 00:41:59,21
and then it will just want to play but we're like from legs to premiums that means it will keep on increasing.

437
00:42:00,07 --> 00:42:03,83
But yes indeed there would have been after we like this like this ups and downs will come

438
00:42:03,83 --> 00:42:07,93
but we should make sure that if we get some critics and all.

439
00:42:08,12 --> 00:42:13,81
We'll keep on doing then go to bed and that we're going to buy the fish things but do not a lot of trials

440
00:42:14,57 --> 00:42:19,22
and we are what about to what the critics we're getting we're just improving their will in Bloomfield.

441
00:42:19,83 --> 00:42:25,46
But we're just beside the a few details in the press and they were designed about what we'll do

442
00:42:25,46 --> 00:42:35,14
and we'll put that in print of the public and public with with a proper set that you were sixty eight years ago.

443
00:42:35,26 --> 00:42:39,27
So you have no nature for you. You have twenty five people working with you.

444
00:42:40,48 --> 00:42:43,94
Where do you make your money of the last eight years. Yes you.

445
00:42:44,42 --> 00:42:50,13
Obviously our programs are not to monitor but we're fact are creating a noise of the product

446
00:42:50,13 --> 00:42:57,62
and this is going to belong to the market that triage on the people the money we're getting is through.

447
00:42:57,64 --> 00:43:05,29
To confidence in business which is the secondary business model. I'm going to say. Of a lot of them.

448
00:43:05,32 --> 00:43:08,75
Isn't that like it's in the name of it in construction

449
00:43:08,75 --> 00:43:13,61
and Cecil would do something continence type of projects for the industries but corporates for the government

450
00:43:14,32 --> 00:43:21,84
and to deal in revenue it becomes one of the revenue source for the company eyes of the president

451
00:43:21,84 --> 00:43:29,88
and second it creates an experience or two about demon or who made them head free on that you know sense

452
00:43:29,88 --> 00:43:32,51
and because they're here today was play knowledge and experience by doing that.

453
00:43:32,76 --> 00:43:41,1
And we take such put their suites will help us to make up artist because we don't do every kind of confidence a

454
00:43:41,1 --> 00:43:43,73
business. We're very focused in even if we're doing it.

455
00:43:43,73 --> 00:43:47,36
Confidence had been there before but that which kind of innovations.

456
00:43:48,41 --> 00:43:55,8
We will take from other planes and would produce which would help us what the mood good experience

457
00:43:55,8 --> 00:44:00,49
or that they can do value about you know our products and what kind of comes up because of the Seas. Very general.

458
00:44:00,55 --> 00:44:08,41
Yes although we are into Iraq. I would be solutions. I mean those are my sons in law.

459
00:44:08,53 --> 00:44:11,68
We have possession of these areas or commissions. I would be solutions.

460
00:44:11,8 --> 00:44:13,87
I look at approaches that a lot many things happen

461
00:44:13,87 --> 00:44:17,99
but we have mainly focused with these if any of the problem in the US

462
00:44:17,99 --> 00:44:26,77
and that has any of those sectors like me make any sound on we just outsource it will some other organized on the part

463
00:44:26,77 --> 00:44:36,81
of our partners on. And looking at yourself as a person sixty years you were first aboard at seventeen I think.

464
00:44:37,12 --> 00:44:39,9
I play sixteen sixes you were awarded.

465
00:44:39,91 --> 00:44:46,48
And then what kind of award to go to afterwards to someone like we're going to go.

466
00:44:46,53 --> 00:44:49,79
I mean not sign on the so many I want it.

467
00:44:49,86 --> 00:44:52,96
Haven't I want to start on because when you what I wanted was an automatic

468
00:44:52,96 --> 00:45:02,47
and obviously in the you would have to boost me too but I wondered next and so you would actually explain

469
00:45:02,47 --> 00:45:07,16
when you get past that I wondered. So you learned that she would have to get a faster one you would up.

470
00:45:07,3 --> 00:45:12,8
I do so many failures that clearly is also that she meant what I feel and fail means fast I can be learning.

471
00:45:12,84 --> 00:45:22,18
If I am so that you should accept something so you will learn through prayer and words alone by actually being dead.

472
00:45:22,22 --> 00:45:24,15
So you are particular of What Not To Do and What.

473
00:45:25,73 --> 00:45:28,9
So what would you not do and what is what you do yes by commenting that

474
00:45:29,88 --> 00:45:34,36
when I did I do just that comment what I did then when I think of anyone in a verse

475
00:45:34,36 --> 00:45:38,15
and I are paired board with the things that when I'm doing this in a Muslim. What didn't.

476
00:45:38,32 --> 00:45:39,92
So I'm not a doing what should I do.

477
00:45:41,11 --> 00:45:47,68
And by the by the platoon in this part like Mark Cuban whatnot do all the you know in a sense what I'm doing

478
00:45:47,68 --> 00:45:49,2
and I got our scene.

479
00:45:49,67 --> 00:45:53,08
When I saw that I sense and and I sometimes International when I was in prison

480
00:45:53,08 --> 00:45:59,96
and where you would sum up briefly what kind of innovations and inventions you did. Can you tell me.

481
00:46:00,07 --> 00:46:05,2
One settles things first the town can begin a long.

482
00:46:05,29 --> 00:46:13,27
OK Fight like one is the inability can say like the bits of which I don't which I just described one is a low cost.

483
00:46:13,49 --> 00:46:22,6
I mean one get one low cost accidental secondly because in hilly areas of a coast in a fall from the mountains because

484
00:46:22,6 --> 00:46:28,46
of the air and water here and all night because the roads are not visible properly and fell from the mountain.

485
00:46:28,96 --> 00:46:36,8
So that no good design to keep that can be implemented in a vehicle by which the vehicle will stop him.

486
00:46:36,82 --> 00:46:42,77
There is no place to move if there is a hole or there's a period where there is that if there is a board

487
00:46:42,77 --> 00:46:50,15
and if there is more on the side of the vehicle responds and then it drips lately move back and put a brick.

488
00:46:50,16 --> 00:46:52,37
Are your brother young.

489
00:46:52,45 --> 00:46:58,63
Yes you are and one of the local system I called it for the for the villagers and for the road end but

490
00:46:58,63 --> 00:46:59,34
when we did that.

491
00:47:00,31 --> 00:47:08,73
Device I mean the heat which can from our electrical of Willis's at the very a powerful place then we did not drive

492
00:47:08,73 --> 00:47:19,64
less cute which can implement in a vacant pool. He and I mean to me to completely. And I've discovered. Yes.

493
00:47:21,81 --> 00:47:23,5
Then we've designed.

494
00:47:24,67 --> 00:47:33,62
A good was going to implement that in any of the home where nobody will be inside the home a lot in terms of room there

495
00:47:33,62 --> 00:47:37,77
will be electrical appliances will be active when nobody will listen to them.

496
00:47:38,5 --> 00:47:43,98
Illiterates they don't will automatically put off because generally we for fun of the device and or

497
00:47:43,98 --> 00:47:49,11
when they were in the line lighting to be there when they were not there and lighting soon get off.

498
00:47:49,21 --> 00:48:02,8
I don't very low cost it after the race. And then. And then some innovations which is not. Exactly. Yeah I mean useful.

499
00:48:03,28 --> 00:48:04,73
For the public directly

500
00:48:04,73 --> 00:48:11,16
but some you know so it's like photo what educational couple you know as we do we do some who create these you know the

501
00:48:11,16 --> 00:48:17,83
other universes which is something that we have you know since we're just going to create interest in the youth sports

502
00:48:17,83 --> 00:48:23,02
technology lets you know us since we started it and don't have a dad when we go to try it and win for it.

503
00:48:23,02 --> 00:48:25,29
Like who fought for the entertainment but it was for the.

504
00:48:25,84 --> 00:48:31,73
Educational but it was and doing the same in us with I'm invited as a guest because in college.

505
00:48:31,73 --> 00:48:33,08
It's not incorporated taught in schools.

506
00:48:33,16 --> 00:48:40,65
I used to discuss let's get hits and that creates interest in the youth to us you know Wes on the storage technology

507
00:48:40,65 --> 00:48:45,1
and all. And so you know most of like there drone that can be operated through my hands.

508
00:48:45,6 --> 00:48:47,5
But I don't know my hand are going to move.

509
00:48:48,05 --> 00:48:51,67
And there's I designed the Iron Man three person

510
00:48:52,47 --> 00:49:01,53
and to my heartbeat if I am because my heart hard to beat then the repros are we going to do it and hand end up to par.

511
00:49:01,59 --> 00:49:07,15
So we get back to it so did others from you know Muslims which is I mean he had interest

512
00:49:07,15 --> 00:49:10,51
and he would because they can connect with just so he did it.

513
00:49:10,6 --> 00:49:17,33
I mean that literally pushed us that this was just in in in a they believe you don't mean a movie

514
00:49:17,33 --> 00:49:22,85
but then all of that and what and when they see that that has been a real fall in the public universe

515
00:49:22,85 --> 00:49:29,42
and so the thing that you know so is so wonderful so beautiful so kind of different in that you know most of these

516
00:49:29,42 --> 00:49:37,06
technologies are really interesting. So they have been given my best and at what they can with in a sense. Accordingly.

517
00:49:37,07 --> 00:49:39,71
I mean we're going to hear these examples which are very nice

518
00:49:39,71 --> 00:49:43,97
but I also think immediately over the life you know that there are three of them the U.S.

519
00:49:43,97 --> 00:49:49,31
Succeeded in Europe but you know. So what. Why don't they import that in India.

520
00:49:50,54 --> 00:49:57,68
Instead of waiting for your invitations to be made see that might be something that was always public or didn't matter.

521
00:49:57,73 --> 00:49:59,7
One pond had been a part of it or done which I have done.

522
00:50:00,07 --> 00:50:09,8
But it's all about the best two hundred best in the in the customer in the other you off your target customer.

523
00:50:10,68 --> 00:50:13,7
When you go in there was a new sign of what are the custom of their target audience.

524
00:50:14,03 --> 00:50:16,94
I'll give an example and from that example you will find the answer.

525
00:50:17,02 --> 00:50:23,43
I mean what I like finally the big sample of Amazon and people. I mean there and then what other great company.

526
00:50:23,44 --> 00:50:25,89
I mustn't is obviously here

527
00:50:25,9 --> 00:50:32,7
and don't enable one was that bloody one thing you can find in India also there is a lot of competition like this.

528
00:50:32,75 --> 00:50:34,82
Amazon that is so I mean in India.

529
00:50:34,83 --> 00:50:39,5
I mean I already under no doubt about there are some in India the people that is not doing that are many e-commerce

530
00:50:39,5 --> 00:50:45,07
companies flipper was the one who admittedly captured the Indian market fast

531
00:50:45,92 --> 00:50:51,2
and why because of the one simplified feature that included Amazon is part of the much better

532
00:50:51,2 --> 00:50:58,17
and big dent clip got a few wins in captured in the Indian market because the bottom the co-founder of the

533
00:50:58,17 --> 00:50:59,84
or not of the flipper it is.

534
00:50:59,84 --> 00:51:00,22
India

535
00:51:00,22 --> 00:51:09,4
and he thought that what that you know what the future then we've done that added best in in the field for that at an

536
00:51:09,4 --> 00:51:13,27
outpatient space where the people would like to be debt free and what do you do.

537
00:51:13,28 --> 00:51:15,11
He just included gas

538
00:51:15,12 --> 00:51:23,97
and anybody up some which I don't include written now on what's what that thing he didn't include at COD up some

539
00:51:25,02 --> 00:51:25,41
and people.

540
00:51:25,53 --> 00:51:32,13
Admittedly for that paper because Indians People generally don't burst on eco most if they if we have passed then they

541
00:51:32,13 --> 00:51:41,18
are to get the products in India people feel their hand to hand give the product they take the money so that one piece

542
00:51:41,18 --> 00:51:45,04
of that created it would he when he kept it to completely the Indian market.

543
00:51:46,75 --> 00:51:52,18
So the person who was to hire their working for my unit was on the one that I am looking into that I am adding such

544
00:51:52,18 --> 00:51:59,98
features which is part of whom I am part of getting the. The question was I mean my target goes.

545
00:52:00,07 --> 00:52:06,05
I'm once in a particular area to whom I am going to be pretty fit was that these are the look that got so much more I

546
00:52:06,05 --> 00:52:14,3
am focusing on. Yes let's say and I'm starting from Indians. Then when I'll go to the global level. I would add AK.

547
00:52:15,00 --> 00:52:21,49
Accordingly if I'm doing. If I'm looking into E.U. Worse. I will absolutely do something this in the features.

548
00:52:21,52 --> 00:52:23,04
If I look in the Saudi.

549
00:52:23,34 --> 00:52:31,03
Are Arab countries I'll do something this in the features so from different players from like there is in Hindi there

550
00:52:31,03 --> 00:52:38,76
is a big step when they decide this. Most of his like of how the new players new people.

551
00:52:38,91 --> 00:52:44,74
So you have to act accordingly. At what their test and on you have to modify so.

552
00:52:44,76 --> 00:52:48,35
Where before I mean new players then with new people. So people.

553
00:52:48,9 --> 00:52:54,79
I mean look but I mean one product will be like when young men are to be led by the decisive men

554
00:52:54,79 --> 00:52:59,38
and led by people in the US. The product which you would like a US men are to be liked by Indians.

555
00:52:59,44 --> 00:53:07,43
So the probably have to keep on sending you a small mountain dislikable if you are tending from Target customer then

556
00:53:07,43 --> 00:53:12,16
you know that it's on the you of of the most when you see Indian. A.B.C.

557
00:53:12,16 --> 00:53:19,39
Food from your future when it's us it should be B. C. D. If it is British terms it may be the so indirectly.

558
00:53:19,6 --> 00:53:23,04
So if I'm focusing Indian stuffy nose or not focus in the other

559
00:53:23,04 --> 00:53:26,2
but other than focusing on this for the because I pondered this A.B.C.

560
00:53:26,2 --> 00:53:29,44
Is going to attack them or will interest in them.

561
00:53:30,32 --> 00:53:31,84
It's as simple as this

562
00:53:31,85 --> 00:53:40,1
and she sort of the uniqueness is also if you were in the for example this hospital looking at this man Dr needing a

563
00:53:40,1 --> 00:53:43,65
wheelchair but he didn't move himself I'm saying more mending there should be affordable.

564
00:53:44,46 --> 00:53:49,74
If the import of those things with the doctor may cost more than two lots of three legs on the other half a million

565
00:53:49,74 --> 00:53:58,83
school at least there no doubt this will to which I have no valid reason low cost is affordable that I keep I even I

566
00:53:58,83 --> 00:54:05,09
give flexible. I give flexible off sounds like both of the parts of the which you need.

567
00:54:05,11 --> 00:54:11,38
You can get but get a place of your own. For going to going to hell and going to get discouraged.

568
00:54:11,54 --> 00:54:17,89
You can bear down you can operate or electrical appliances you can actually say this if you want to move on.

569
00:54:17,92 --> 00:54:22,84
We can design in local after the world will tell you and your customers will

570
00:54:22,84 --> 00:54:24,81
and we can implement of keeping the wheelchair.

571
00:54:26,56 --> 00:54:32,23
So that providing the space cell of simple the that it was done on makes them feel special

572
00:54:32,23 --> 00:54:38,06
and they choose you would rather than to any others why they would invest such.

573
00:54:39,6 --> 00:54:48,19
I mean what money if they're getting the special thing and after the race. So I know that what exactly is going to.

574
00:54:49,24 --> 00:54:54,84
Attack them in unconscionable and how many will churn owners

575
00:54:54,84 --> 00:55:01,13
or people that are good produce able are usually your can guarantee there will be more then one day I can see what will

576
00:55:01,13 --> 00:55:09,45
be this is not a product which. I don't own brand. So doing the politicians until some tie up more than a sense.

577
00:55:09,47 --> 00:55:11,01
I mean.

578
00:55:11,03 --> 00:55:15,92
There's just the devil of some of the units and we help them in developing those bits of cures

579
00:55:15,92 --> 00:55:23,89
and it was being either destroyed by many of the you just maybe to a gimme some sort of industry

580
00:55:23,89 --> 00:55:26,9
but obviously we don't come much less in this universe

581
00:55:26,9 --> 00:55:36,89
and we are just seems to have met a company so that they can become a slave in a button with. Color choices. This. And.

582
00:55:37,73 --> 00:55:44,67
When you look around below who are your heroes. If you were in your vision somebody that you would like to be.

583
00:55:45,19 --> 00:55:50,63
You think warm embrace of that's what people and everyone sort of people I mean he knows.

584
00:55:50,65 --> 00:55:59,03
Responses of people I learn what to do and every from every sort of people I learn what NOT to do this.

585
00:56:00,07 --> 00:56:00,49
Legace

586
00:56:00,49 --> 00:56:06,1
and people are going to like Bill Gates Steve Jobs each one of them like Elon Musk like these people are massive You

587
00:56:06,1 --> 00:56:13,8
don't know what will I learn everything I would like how they are to struggle stays in all London what are the things

588
00:56:13,8 --> 00:56:21,4
which they make mistakes and the need to restart from that and from there I suppose I don't know.

589
00:56:21,43 --> 00:56:28,44
But I assume not when my True Blood so that I can start to live without hardly itch. If I'm if I'm there.

590
00:56:28,51 --> 00:56:34,96
If I have something on the young is because of that I would try to learn from other states Prince what I would have

591
00:56:34,96 --> 00:56:40,14
done by which they've got and I wonder I'm going to bed got to achievement.

592
00:56:40,34 --> 00:56:47,41
So now you know if you take the example in most like to people what I want to hear out on get on one fifteen million

593
00:56:47,41 --> 00:56:54,99
dollars a year on where you will be up on the computer models and as Space X. We don't know the impulse buy.

594
00:56:54,99 --> 00:56:57,37
You did he even didn't say every single penny.

595
00:56:57,58 --> 00:57:03,39
I mean he bought of that and those days he was brought in from his friends and he was staying in a rented homes.

596
00:57:03,57 --> 00:57:05,88
I don't know what he did what he bought

597
00:57:05,88 --> 00:57:10,7
but I think he was more forced to live use them even you don't want to say in his pocket.

598
00:57:10,71 --> 00:57:15,91
I've seen a single before you can invest that to fulfill his vision he did that he was completely involved in

599
00:57:15,91 --> 00:57:23,00
fulfilling his vision small part in many maybe done what I feel that what we have done is an eight from where you put

600
00:57:23,00 --> 00:57:29,24
it on yourself What makes you a visionary for others who think. See I don't want to see every human being.

601
00:57:29,36 --> 00:57:38,23
Tenting their lives with us live where I live should have a bungalow easy drive a car he will have a vacant lot we will

602
00:57:38,23 --> 00:57:42,05
need a lot more left and everyone watched it

603
00:57:43,78 --> 00:57:50,98
but there are some people who are to their day live just for cause death there how we're going back to that.

604
00:57:51,1 --> 00:57:54,49
How in the world going to be the house how we've been getting there.

605
00:57:54,56 --> 00:58:00,00
But our dream God but how we'll have a lot of bank balance the focus to debt and.

606
00:58:00,07 --> 00:58:05,36
Some people want that kind of life but I'm not focusing on that I know dirty play.

607
00:58:05,38 --> 00:58:12,02
I don't focus movies and everything will come every dream will put in that place.

608
00:58:13,13 --> 00:58:15,31
So everything we put in the place I born in before cause.

609
00:58:15,47 --> 00:58:19,89
How much my bank will learns how much software that I would have had their dream house on order whether I managed

610
00:58:19,89 --> 00:58:21,7
or not I would have a dream car not.

611
00:58:21,79 --> 00:58:28,53
I don't need to focus that I know that this all this recess and all the dreams we fulfil apply to fulfill my vision.

612
00:58:28,56 --> 00:58:33,29
If I stick to my visa. It's everything will get put in my bag.

613
00:58:34,88 --> 00:58:39,54
So this all will be pulled in many so I'm just kind of yes I know that I was going to say that

614
00:58:39,54 --> 00:58:40,73
but focusing on the visa.

615
00:58:40,89 --> 00:58:47,57
So if I had to step out of the zone everything will be and very but I want real happiness that I'm going to get is

616
00:58:47,57 --> 00:58:54,81
when the vision is fulfilled when everyone. If I find a new one. Someone said I saw you just joined my life.

617
00:58:54,86 --> 00:58:56,56
You know wasn't easy to change my life.

618
00:58:56,69 --> 00:59:02,92
The doctors said you might see me rather than that seeing of these and this but how dream.

619
00:59:03,22 --> 00:59:09,25
That is my dream also dream God if I get a statement now to some this universe and a zealot in my life.

620
00:59:09,4 --> 00:59:17,1
Thank you so much. My head that I hear this small children from my use of I'm more than happy.

621
00:59:17,12 --> 00:59:26,19
And good but then so why are you in the eyes of other people visionary.

622
00:59:26,21 --> 00:59:33,39
Because I have my reason why I am every day much of that the words I do now gives when you add to the vision

623
00:59:33,39 --> 00:59:42,83
and what I would like to decide do I used every day one led out of the end of the vision

624
00:59:42,83 --> 00:59:50,33
and people can always see that if I wouldn't be seen by others then that's why they feel that I was in a.

625
00:59:52,04 --> 00:59:57,56
So we will be the next your most probably yeah I know I would love to hear.

626
00:59:57,58 --> 01:00:05,37
First of all you want to tell someone about. Bigger example. Yes You ask whether I want to be a the next.

627
01:00:05,42 --> 01:00:09,24
And I must I would say yes I want to be done next. And I must cover India.

628
01:00:09,4 --> 01:00:15,87
I can sing because I don't want to see the dearly get upset an entrepreneur and past. I want to be myself.

629
01:00:16,08 --> 01:00:22,05
I want to be son but Nick was the best suited to the next day and in most of India.

630
01:00:23,23 --> 01:00:31,89
So obviously it would mean uniqueness with me some university of my own to put on mine.

631
01:00:31,95 --> 01:00:39,01
Obviously I mean if I were able to fulfill that vision that ability of the vision family able to impact millions of

632
01:00:39,01 --> 01:00:47,87
lives the lives of like and obviously it will mean that it's died pushing it would not be good and would.

633
01:00:47,89 --> 01:00:57,41
Just happen in the world are you just mentioned before that pull in but with wild right in the next five years then

634
01:00:57,41 --> 01:01:04,35
and obviously to rebuild lives would be your key would is that if that was any that's it in the next five years.

635
01:01:05,57 --> 01:01:08,08
What kind of problems you encounter here in India.

636
01:01:08,1 --> 01:01:14,25
I suppose it's one success story or I've received the phone to find problems and you should come to India.

637
01:01:14,3 --> 01:01:17,00
I can see because that is a lot on and to problems.

638
01:01:17,28 --> 01:01:22,68
I had seen that if that is a problem then that's sad to me because that is when the things that we can learn

639
01:01:22,68 --> 01:01:26,65
and look when the things we can explore and develop a new bit we can use out of mind.

640
01:01:27,21 --> 01:01:31,83
There was something was going to solve that and cover problem and that problem

641
01:01:31,83 --> 01:01:40,01
and maybe did it go into if you will be pushed by the other parts of the world as it so that can get him back in that

642
01:01:40,02 --> 01:01:47,81
day as I was about to anyone that is in India is not only solving the problems of Indian people it is also so in the

643
01:01:47,81 --> 01:01:58,6
lives of the global people as with so you are she Indian problems and trying to find solutions for that. Exactly. And.

644
01:02:00,07 --> 01:02:08,42
Only question what are what makes more you invent more unique than water already exists in the world.

645
01:02:09,38 --> 01:02:14,56
See I don't focus on hole and put it in over to me I've done in the universe

646
01:02:14,56 --> 01:02:19,44
and it happened splendidly let you know what happened there. Depends to make it more user friendly.

647
01:02:19,72 --> 01:02:21,3
I just group will make and he was a friend

648
01:02:21,3 --> 01:02:27,06
and one group we could create a universe of if something that is similar to the existing universe

649
01:02:27,06 --> 01:02:32,29
and if my notion has some extra one features. I like them I can get in a listen. And let live.

650
01:02:32,44 --> 01:02:37,68
But was that it was of the market with them individually whether to me or the nascent company or the tool type idea

651
01:02:37,68 --> 01:02:41,31
and I don't know what the interest in the quote I was with all that on automation such companies.

652
01:02:41,37 --> 01:02:46,33
So if they didn't buy every wedding that is one featured in the universe

653
01:02:46,33 --> 01:02:52,59
and they were just really creating it in back then I would like to post it if it should more than make it easier for

654
01:02:52,59 --> 01:02:59,14
internet or than we can get to great company of us and school. So it happens when I'm focusing committed to. U.E.

655
01:02:59,14 --> 01:03:06,77
User friendly it becomes the innovation. I write for the series we filmed in the most moral lapse.

656
01:03:07,00 --> 01:03:17,39
You can't imagine like the unique. Yesterday in the fact that I have to admit it was not a most modern and.

657
01:03:17,4 --> 01:03:23,11
How is that from the fact I love the music of a sheet.

658
01:03:24,07 --> 01:03:28,67
Yeah that's we updated a clear close and make a space step a place where I don't make it.

659
01:03:28,68 --> 01:03:33,73
We just want to make the people like to make you know what those will do

660
01:03:33,73 --> 01:03:39,9
and upsets people less of us in such lab we just provide. Oh you just give me a list and I say lab.

661
01:03:40,18 --> 01:03:42,17
I mean they can access the lab equipments

662
01:03:42,17 --> 01:03:45,15
and they can do something they can advance from that I guess build prototypes

663
01:03:45,15 --> 01:03:47,52
and products like yesterday you filmed art

664
01:03:47,52 --> 01:03:52,42
and you saw that how there are some different take on Social what we in some to do different things.

665
01:03:52,56 --> 01:03:57,06
So we're just bright look at ecosystem where the other makers and other you know what this will come

666
01:03:57,06 --> 01:04:00,57
and you know it's more than likely. One space.

667
01:04:00,6 --> 01:04:06,41
So people can go and get something that they were glad they would have to process

668
01:04:06,42 --> 01:04:09,25
but finally they will do something that is going to greatly impact.

669
01:04:10,31 --> 01:04:18,43
So that's a place if it's blessed with all provided by the young and then they will then when they would come.

670
01:04:20,56 --> 01:04:21,48
In that doctors are for peace.

671
01:04:21,5 --> 01:04:28,77
So if they wish to keep struggling to do then obviously if they are in their time and effort

672
01:04:28,77 --> 01:04:32,92
and creating that space then they were started in the new project under a lot of pain

673
01:04:33,72 --> 01:04:43,32
and efficiency are degrees so you know how did these guys don't need to get I mean they had to watch space which we

674
01:04:43,32 --> 01:04:49,00
have already created so there's a need to exclude that ideas into products and push to the market

675
01:04:49,00 --> 01:04:51,22
and we will help provide that because this time.

676
01:04:51,22 --> 01:04:58,04
That meant that tantalizing ecosystem that getting value of what I was on ecosystems language that can.

677
01:04:58,18 --> 01:05:06,36
It was going to get in the market are possible to start bits of the television experience you had with so it's it's

678
01:05:06,36 --> 01:05:12,2
good to have a bit of a clumsy kind of luck because then you can discover and understand is that right.

679
01:05:12,25 --> 01:05:16,59
And obviously when there are more and more like we even blood that make us

680
01:05:16,59 --> 01:05:21,06
and you know what does we will come out the middle because I don't know what will walk out on under one umbrella

681
01:05:21,77 --> 01:05:26,64
and obviously the ecosystem where we can discuss each other we can get it. We can create critics.

682
01:05:27,18 --> 01:05:37,65
And finally of best result will come out of there. When you develop and they will obviously.

683
01:05:37,67 --> 01:05:44,18
It's like you create a place where you from your vet you can research the television. Yes. It's something over there.

684
01:05:44,54 --> 01:05:45,81
When you when I hear you.

685
01:05:45,84 --> 01:05:52,54
Your best dancer who does you have your friends open

686
01:05:52,54 --> 01:06:01,36
or close close close so these the eyes closed so it will open the polls open up on their own home. I should open it up.

687
01:06:01,48 --> 01:06:02,64
Please as it will.

688
01:06:03,1 --> 01:06:10,5
You know we don't have to do it again but I mean is that just from from our audience are very open to that.

689
01:06:10,56 --> 01:06:25,07
So you know that's that's what's our responsibility. So when you talk you talk like a person with local experience.

690
01:06:25,21 --> 01:06:26,71
If you're only twenty four years old

691
01:06:26,71 --> 01:06:31,29
but I have seven year sixpence in the field of you know since I don't are going to wait and see.

692
01:06:32,33 --> 01:06:39,26
A lot of them obviously I would have been corporate governance of a company. In things I was struck by consent.

693
01:06:39,27 --> 01:06:47,31
I would you know what percentage in things. And I wish one is empowered in future. So we have incorporated last year.

694
01:06:47,31 --> 01:06:52,06
Let me put off he said in governing which started the journey and.

695
01:06:52,93 --> 01:06:59,71
Lot of struggles and all of that gives us a experience and by exposing.

696
01:07:01,42 --> 01:07:06,96
There's a lot of explain to us and we must do we had a long nose when the when and when if when we.

697
01:07:07,01 --> 01:07:16,83
But it's to the experts and we had it. When the learning acted too late. About a possible come about for us to even to.

698
01:07:16,85 --> 01:07:22,03
If I'm able to learn something from to live with what more than a better than what we wish you know I'm getting a

699
01:07:22,03 --> 01:07:24,22
chance to learn if I'm interacting with us.

700
01:07:24,34 --> 01:07:28,93
They are learning from me and I was learning from them so that learning attitude we keep

701
01:07:28,93 --> 01:07:35,33
and actually I think we are progressing and I did some very very self one of the new way forward in the I form.

702
01:07:35,37 --> 01:07:39,29
What did you learn personally. From the lots.

703
01:07:39,31 --> 01:07:47,19
As you were from still quite young when you started to succeed with your first invention corpse. What did you want.

704
01:07:47,24 --> 01:07:53,32
What makes you so successful. So I just follow my passion past my passion is this technology.

705
01:07:53,51 --> 01:07:59,52
You know I'm just one of my passion and I'm just being a pass on to a profession and that's it and I really.

706
01:08:00,86 --> 01:08:06,08
That's from his past is in the subset of people that fill in the heart Money comes

707
01:08:06,08 --> 01:08:15,29
and I'm the where if pledge on the Soul that is never a matter of his will because you might be doing something which

708
01:08:15,29 --> 01:08:21,53
you want on the millions but even when you're following a passion. What do you want on the list.

709
01:08:21,66 --> 01:08:25,45
But despite some of his foot in the past. Unless it's absolutely with us.

710
01:08:26,24 --> 01:08:26,69
He's happy

711
01:08:26,69 --> 01:08:36,38
and despite all of us one thing we probably every night two hundred become competent at least every night the person

712
01:08:36,38 --> 01:08:37,2
will hunting.

713
01:08:37,34 --> 01:08:46,98
I mean hunting when I have my list like in his dreams maybe so he hasn't had a knot or poor dad some of it.

714
01:08:47,14 --> 01:08:53,8
He was interested or he didn't follow his best and he might he would one might and he might want to be a good writer

715
01:08:54,58 --> 01:08:59,77
but he was being some in ninety five job or he got a better job in any ministry. He's running late.

716
01:09:01,36 --> 01:09:06,24
Every month but he will to get it repaired or degrade will keep on hunting every night bear.

717
01:09:06,51 --> 01:09:13,05
He didn't follow his bison. So I'd better not get the feeling that you follow the pass on and follow the heart.

718
01:09:15,01 --> 01:09:21,34
And that's what you're doing in that where if you let em sex will lead that is things like how where that how much

719
01:09:21,34 --> 01:09:26,09
you're creating very gotta how much Donovan of done how much money you you alone.

720
01:09:27,47 --> 01:09:31,68
Will be just a part of the life and that is going to happen time

721
01:09:31,68 --> 01:09:37,4
and time so I really wish it was modeled that we should focus on what I do forming a pass on

722
01:09:37,4 --> 01:09:51,95
and clip on how you are making them better. Nice to you and. Can you give me. What for you. I'm sorry for you.

723
01:09:54,15 --> 01:09:59,87
The magic word. I mean clearly you do your work really think wow is this.

724
01:10:00,3 --> 01:10:08,45
Drives Me seen all of us keep exposure sometime use of that that's what I learn and it vital to our inner demon

725
01:10:08,45 --> 01:10:16,69
or even national a lot of us and they rightly would expect isms not to be effectiveness and to be expected

726
01:10:16,69 --> 01:10:20,46
when you put yourself with a guy that he lets you would or you wouldn't

727
01:10:20,46 --> 01:10:25,54
but it is more time that he lets it because you are going to prove it is a difference.

728
01:10:26,33 --> 01:10:31,56
I will ask my hand I will thing that I still if there's a what about him I would ask my hand

729
01:10:31,56 --> 01:10:38,93
and get that part of her to me so I will go and get a good daughter when I do come now that is it if I expect that.

730
01:10:39,24 --> 01:10:42,77
I will ask you that you weren't going to talk about her for me that books and that would bother you

731
01:10:42,77 --> 01:10:47,61
when you get to that option for nor even asking their dad what order for me.

732
01:10:47,76 --> 01:10:52,99
If I asked my stepson one get it out of the door for me so that dance is more his

733
01:10:52,99 --> 01:10:57,51
and more suited I can get a daughter with him. So it will give expert on New Years with anybody.

734
01:10:59,01 --> 01:11:01,92
If you are not able to explain to them how you are going to thing that

735
01:11:01,92 --> 01:11:09,54
or how you would to measure improvement from that museum. So that's the little one whom we are expecting is.

736
01:11:09,74 --> 01:11:12,04
Is it a matter of them some.

737
01:11:12,06 --> 01:11:18,89
We are or the series of every episode has an arch dark markets are and you are and are the maker.

738
01:11:18,96 --> 01:11:28,97
You know you are you are you really without Yeah I am him because maybe it is also you know her does it make you a

739
01:11:28,97 --> 01:11:32,95
creative soul. He has a free body is free.

740
01:11:32,98 --> 01:11:38,37
You could do what he wants he played havoc and all but finally that I don't matters

741
01:11:38,37 --> 01:11:42,6
when you are on entrepreneurs you are creating impact you make art graceful.

742
01:11:43,65 --> 01:11:50,36
How can anything destroy anything peered in that thing without focusing that way that it is going to be back on his

743
01:11:50,36 --> 01:11:55,94
or straight with your do while we picked out of the notes and we typing when you do does shooting in the Fabulous.

744
01:11:56,08 --> 01:12:00,44
You see that of how differently. We have done something you know since and on. How badly.

745
01:12:01,8 --> 01:12:08,91
Just so kind of do not even see it would try to solve the part of the problem in that perspective dying what we didn't

746
01:12:08,91 --> 01:12:15,4
do didn't. What was it how that these things are going to great impact but finally you up at dawn and on entrepreneurs.

747
01:12:16,17 --> 01:12:23,16
If we want to make it to the I mean to the global people.

748
01:12:24,07 --> 01:12:31,15
So I make our professional model what finally I'll put I'm an entrepreneur had gotten better by being unable to

749
01:12:31,15 --> 01:12:44,64
inaudible creating impact. OK Thank you. But for us or for us.

750
01:12:45,28 --> 01:12:53,75
Could you explain what is the difference in innovating for Indian markets comparing it to other markets worldwide

751
01:12:53,75 --> 01:12:57,88
or the U.S. Market from what's the difference between the innovations.

752
01:12:57,98 --> 01:13:03,4
What is the difference for innovating for Indian markets.

753
01:13:03,98 --> 01:13:09,94
Comparing it to other markets for what makes Indian markets are all different from call for specially if all of the

754
01:13:09,94 --> 01:13:11,87
mentioned the C.

755
01:13:11,87 --> 01:13:12,51
You know us

756
01:13:12,51 --> 01:13:18,44
and we at that audience are the as I to get the product you have to make them that feel that I should get a program to

757
01:13:18,44 --> 01:13:23,11
see everyone pull that one something if in the idea of the need of what I want them.

758
01:13:23,89 --> 01:13:29,22
This the absence of such clarity is like they should get more quantity

759
01:13:30,22 --> 01:13:32,41
but quality they should get out from the old place.

760
01:13:32,62 --> 01:13:41,15
So you know this keeps on credit as if there is a good actor to any of the perp

761
01:13:41,15 --> 01:13:49,18
and MOST him apart from this tweet most important is that if we knew as anyone is a reference reporting is giving the

762
01:13:49,18 --> 01:14:00,00
money of that product if any of his friends is how do you know that this explains what I want is that he also then.

763
01:14:00,07 --> 01:14:05,16
And that in the end is going to get that product which is friend but I thought so that

764
01:14:05,16 --> 01:14:12,92
when I was about Bob published the matters fast and then didn't get into the other but it did.

765
01:14:12,93 --> 01:14:16,06
I'm talking of the misery. Not every one of them is a pretty.

766
01:14:16,98 --> 01:14:22,64
So your profit would you know it's such a level where it would get into my it would create a noise.

767
01:14:22,74 --> 01:14:32,05
It would get into the people's multiplicity itself make them feel that special tool that they can do source in Indians

768
01:14:32,05 --> 01:14:39,44
people talk over the i Pads in pretty high when he lets people know who the actually quit i Pads.

769
01:14:40,17 --> 01:14:43,58
While many people the part of that we CAN I thought I

770
01:14:45,01 --> 01:14:52,09
and I saw sometime I feel that Apple makes us proud of to to give it messes that you don't have your own value.

771
01:14:52,12 --> 01:14:57,74
Get out get our product that in because of having sometimes a lot of the U.I.

772
01:14:57,74 --> 01:15:02,69
and I mean we maybe don't but I put that in it and that embed happens more than Indians.

773
01:15:03,54 --> 01:15:07,57
There are people who don't even need to use a phone properly did just know how to call they don't know

774
01:15:07,57 --> 01:15:13,29
but he was absent anything not to get a phone does produce wealth they feel that they're valuing because by getting

775
01:15:13,29 --> 01:15:16,08
such products. I will not get that burn.

776
01:15:16,12 --> 01:15:22,99
It's a great product but if you really don't take it if you are utilizing all the features

777
01:15:22,99 --> 01:15:26,74
and what is dear are those going to simple fun if you just want to make a call

778
01:15:26,74 --> 01:15:33,05
and we really don't know what he's going to make you should search for the Indian markets.

779
01:15:33,19 --> 01:15:38,98
Instead of other companies that come from abroad. So obviously being an Indian and I know them.

780
01:15:39,15 --> 01:15:41,12
I understand the mentality of the Indians.

781
01:15:41,17 --> 01:15:50,32
I know what they exactly once and what I still include in a product so that they will be easily fascinated

782
01:15:50,33 --> 01:15:54,34
or they will be easily at record words a product that will make them feel special.

783
01:15:55,54 --> 01:15:59,83
So everything I am putting into the consequentialism. So like if people.

784
01:16:00,07 --> 01:16:02,88
Coming from Abu Wilton to make a program to put in the market.

785
01:16:02,93 --> 01:16:08,59
They don't understand exactly unmentioned Now you can see just recently example of Apple.

786
01:16:08,61 --> 01:16:14,74
There's just because the place of the upper and use the rest of the volume.

787
01:16:14,77 --> 01:16:22,06
Does that I mean the volume sales increased drastically. So there might be some Indian in there in the apple.

788
01:16:22,65 --> 01:16:26,64
In the apple in the out of what I want to say one of those are going to turn in

789
01:16:26,64 --> 01:16:33,17
and it will move out about kidnapper might have suggested that if you were Buddhists then this then that it was going

790
01:16:33,17 --> 01:16:36,63
to Destin only includes a number of sales in India.

791
01:16:36,68 --> 01:16:43,06
So if you want to because of the number Indians and you know it's a great market like it's more than one million.

792
01:16:43,71 --> 01:16:44,34
Populous on.

793
01:16:45,9 --> 01:16:53,86
I mean we I mean if you annoy India so to them that is more in film I mean the in a person is more than one we until

794
01:16:53,86 --> 01:16:54,55
that is more school.

795
01:16:54,84 --> 01:17:04,47
How do you go and are you going to say look progress in the Indian market so if you follow some that I'm going to us

796
01:17:05,64 --> 01:17:11,39
and that in I'm going to the main thing is that the obviously if you are from Netherlands then.

797
01:17:11,4 --> 01:17:13,68
You know but what product.

798
01:17:14,66 --> 01:17:21,98
One has to be done then that is going to model at the Netherland audience on the net and people I get and

799
01:17:21,98 --> 01:17:25,69
when I enter the get up muscles focus product we do that

800
01:17:25,69 --> 01:17:28,84
and then if you if there are companies in the US who are out

801
01:17:28,84 --> 01:17:36,13
and I saw a part of your body is going to say what do you want to be in India. If I make a product which your pardon.

802
01:17:36,17 --> 01:17:41,79
Maybe one hundred times better than my part of what I would be including some in that part of my part is one percent

803
01:17:41,79 --> 01:17:56,32
for sale because I was going that when we attack in the Indian mindset. You are.

804
01:18:01,35 --> 01:18:02,28
I don't know many

805
01:18:02,28 --> 01:18:10,63
but I meant is that age should be such a word that it will get them out publicly then the local one might not like to

806
01:18:10,63 --> 01:18:21,75
get the i Phone out to get us. Samsung Galaxy phone. It's a much more costly and then in pocket money that. Scared.

807
01:18:22,7 --> 01:18:26,38
I mean there are some home video and home.

808
01:18:26,97 --> 01:18:32,96
There and there but but but but all promptly and they add all the pocket monies and all but they get their i Phone

809
01:18:32,96 --> 01:18:42,76
or this Galaxy phone. Because that has created a noise and there. That has created royalty. A while for you.

810
01:18:44,42 --> 01:18:51,31
If a million friends community if you are using i Phone not going to get special treatment for the home policy what you

811
01:18:51,31 --> 01:18:57,6
have by phone while you office. Samsung phone. Samsung Galaxy top people appreciate. So the dad.

812
01:18:58,19 --> 01:19:04,37
Did it and there will be some other some students will be jealous that you people have that his friend has a i Phone

813
01:19:04,37 --> 01:19:11,85
and i don't have to dead jealousy that to prove that royalist people.

814
01:19:13,19 --> 01:19:17,19
Buy the product and that doctors mold their stuff casting by with people.

815
01:19:18,69 --> 01:19:22,03
But is that part of the people who are really required.

816
01:19:22,95 --> 01:19:29,97
I have coming into the second video to democracy is a past master says that that creates a did did not create a

817
01:19:29,97 --> 01:19:34,5
delicacy. If if you approach.

818
01:19:34,97 --> 01:19:38,12
If someone is pulling a really special and after sitting

819
01:19:38,12 --> 01:19:41,03
and they are feeling the loss that this person has that product.

820
01:19:41,05 --> 01:19:48,38
Well it is creating a while we fit everyone is uplifting Wow you have the spirit of so that jealousy would make others

821
01:19:48,38 --> 01:19:55,41
to get that part of. I learn from whens I do in the company will be manifesting that part of wins.
