1
00:00:00,25 --> 00:00:08,12
So I thank you Martin for of willing your willingness to do this because if you do it.

2
00:00:08,12 --> 00:00:12,95
With your very special location we are in the heart of Vatican City Why are we here

3
00:00:13,86 --> 00:00:21,98
but we're here in the Vatican because the Vatican has a Academy of Science koma Pontifical Academy of Science which has

4
00:00:22,12 --> 00:00:30,92
conferences on various topics and the members seventy or eighty scientists from all over the world of all faiths

5
00:00:30,93 --> 00:00:36,12
and now so it's a really global academy and we have scientific discussions

6
00:00:36,4 --> 00:00:44,95
but I think one useful thing we can do is address issues of social import where if we can interest the authorities in

7
00:00:44,96 --> 00:00:47,05
the Vatican it can make a difference

8
00:00:47,24 --> 00:00:57,77
and to give one example we had a conference eighteen months ago in May twenty fourth team on sustainability climate

9
00:00:57,78 --> 00:01:01,25
and the environment and this got traction within the Vatican

10
00:01:01,87 --> 00:01:12,07
and it then led to the Papal Encyclical it made twenty fifteen which of course was a very important influence on the

11
00:01:12,11 --> 00:01:13,51
Paris environmental

12
00:01:13,69 --> 00:01:21,86
and tribal conference in December twenty first fifteen because of course the pope has immense traction especially not

13
00:01:21,87 --> 00:01:23,92
in America or Africa or the station

14
00:01:24,33 --> 00:01:31,26
and I think the fact that the pope would come out strongly in favor of the importance of concern about climate

15
00:01:31,51 --> 00:01:38,77
and our duties to the environment has a big effect in easing the past a consensus at the Paris coffers so that's an

16
00:01:38,78 --> 00:01:45,25
example where the part if it had to be can I think have a more distinctive road than other national academies

17
00:01:45,42 --> 00:01:50,03
but you also have meetings on the cosmology and other subjects like that.

18
00:01:50,03 --> 00:01:57,13
Where you kind of surprised that particular in this kind of climate change debate Pope Francis kind of came out as such

19
00:01:57,14 --> 00:02:03,53
a strong I would almost say voice of reason. In a world that's sometimes very confused.

20
00:02:03,53 --> 00:02:08,35
But I think it was surprising gratifying because the other point that came out in that

21
00:02:08,51 --> 00:02:13,78
and sickle was the humanities duty to the environment and of course aloof

22
00:02:13,79 --> 00:02:21,38
and sisters have had that view the Church itself has had to live in that men have dominion over nature as it were so

23
00:02:21,61 --> 00:02:26,74
the statement fairly clearly that the environment has a value in each other right

24
00:02:26,99 --> 00:02:33,57
and we have an obligation to defend it is something which I think was not clearly apparent in earlier Catholic

25
00:02:33,58 --> 00:02:36,95
statements so not only I would say kind of the environment

26
00:02:37,16 --> 00:02:46,55
and you know human beings taking care of nature was also very specific and all are in terms of global and equity

27
00:02:46,59 --> 00:02:54,19
and the fact that the poor were mostly affected by these issues Yes Well that's right I think of course the things that

28
00:02:54,2 --> 00:03:00,57
everyone can agree about the church is that it's got a global perspective it thinks long term

29
00:03:00,72 --> 00:03:02,29
and it cares about the world's poor

30
00:03:02,83 --> 00:03:09,16
and in the context of climate change of course the made victims of it will be the poor

31
00:03:09,81 --> 00:03:16,46
and the concern is something which is not short term a concern about future generations because they're the ones who

32
00:03:16,47 --> 00:03:18,33
will bear the impact of climate change

33
00:03:18,5 --> 00:03:27,1
and so the church really has all the prerequisites to be a body that can have a real global influence on this debate do

34
00:03:27,11 --> 00:03:33,64
you feel any tension between faith and science particularly if you're here.

35
00:03:33,64 --> 00:03:40,66
I don't think there is any tension because of course the Church used to course be concerned I mean until twenty five

36
00:03:40,67 --> 00:03:45,67
years ago it wasn't good to talk to much like Alan they have to think it changed completely and I have

37
00:03:45,98 --> 00:03:50,3
and the church is very happy to engage in debates on.

38
00:03:50,3 --> 00:03:51,92
Issues like evolution

39
00:03:51,93 --> 00:03:59,58
and cosmology etc I look cosmologists are quite happy to talk about the big back so talk about the value of knowledge

40
00:03:59,59 --> 00:04:06,67
and. It's kind of striking. For one of the previous presidents of this to carry.

41
00:04:06,67 --> 00:04:11,01
A choice no matter he it was both an ordained priest

42
00:04:11,02 --> 00:04:19,36
but he was also in some sense the father of the expanding universe and a big back.

43
00:04:19,36 --> 00:04:24,09
So that's something that's perhaps that's a surprise for people to hear it is surprising

44
00:04:24,1 --> 00:04:32,72
and he was in fact they've remarkable scientist who started in Cambridge at MIT and then he worked.

45
00:04:32,72 --> 00:04:36,21
In Belgium his career and he became president of this academy

46
00:04:36,91 --> 00:04:44,42
but he was indeed one of the early people who applied Einstein's theory to motif of the universe

47
00:04:44,64 --> 00:04:51,04
and had the idea of a big bang which we call the primeval atom and he thought they deeply about these questions

48
00:04:51,24 --> 00:04:56,45
and came up with models which are still part of the.

49
00:04:56,45 --> 00:04:58,65
Folklore the subject as it were and I found it

50
00:04:58,66 --> 00:05:05,57
and like this idea from the get no it wasn't it Einstein actually was rather reluctant to accept all the most exciting

51
00:05:05,96 --> 00:05:08,93
conclusions of his theory he'd have like black holes for his desk

52
00:05:09,36 --> 00:05:14,93
but each didn't like the idea of them the expanded universe he was the static universe

53
00:05:15,19 --> 00:05:22,22
and also he you know although we did he introduced this thing called the Coffee a constant which is a latent force in

54
00:05:22,23 --> 00:05:30,94
empty space he didn't like it and then the maÃ®tre tried to argue that it was some effect that might be genuine

55
00:05:31,26 --> 00:05:32,84
and later turned out to be right because

56
00:05:32,85 --> 00:05:39,41
when we got discoveries the last fifty years has been that this force in empty space does exist yet very important for

57
00:05:39,42 --> 00:05:44,82
the future universe so what do you think of factor right close really very real.

58
00:05:44,82 --> 00:05:52,98
But the song sounds good to say that his theory was even more clever he was it was because Stein of course through his

59
00:05:52,99 --> 00:05:59,98
huge insight. There looked this theory but its consequences took decades to be fully.

60
00:06:00,19 --> 00:06:05,71
Understood and things like black holes the Big Bang

61
00:06:06,07 --> 00:06:14,2
and gravitational waves which are regarded now as the great convertor tests of the theory in all three cases

62
00:06:14,39 --> 00:06:17,1
and Stein was negative or ambivalent

63
00:06:17,5 --> 00:06:25,05
and also in all three cases only recently that we got convincing evidence something you said something about the state

64
00:06:25,18 --> 00:06:32,18
of more use if you really think about it in terms of a long term investment in good human kind has been thinking about

65
00:06:32,19 --> 00:06:32,78
a cause

66
00:06:32,79 --> 00:06:39,61
or a millennium Yes Yes But what's happening right at this moment is well of course it is insane as you say that to

67
00:06:39,89 --> 00:06:48,17
Einstein's theory was special and he was uniquely original scientist because he came up with this theory.

68
00:06:48,17 --> 00:06:55,52
As a result made me of pure thought it was the stimulated by posting experiments where you started your story you start

69
00:06:55,53 --> 00:07:02,00
to say you have offered to fifty years to allude to it it had it not been Feinstein then the theory would not have been

70
00:07:02,01 --> 00:07:07,78
developed for four decades and indeed it was into the one nine hundred sixty S.

71
00:07:08,3 --> 00:07:15,4
That astronomers found the first entities in the universe where Einstein's effect was inspiring Portland welcome just

72
00:07:15,41 --> 00:07:18,79
being a tiny correction to Newton's theory in one hundred sixty S.

73
00:07:19,59 --> 00:07:23,37
We found a place called neutron stars stars the masses sound

74
00:07:23,38 --> 00:07:26,89
but squeeze down into that down if you have a few kilometers

75
00:07:27,4 --> 00:07:32,36
and also black holes object which it collapsed because you can does offer the rest of the universe

76
00:07:32,37 --> 00:07:39,79
but even gravitational imprint for that is best left and evidence that these things emerged in the sixty's

77
00:07:39,8 --> 00:07:40,54
and seventy's

78
00:07:40,74 --> 00:07:49,21
and also evidence emerged that our universe had to evolve from some very dense hot state there's a so-called background

79
00:07:49,22 --> 00:07:54,25
radiation which fills the universe and is a relic of the hot dense beginnings of the universe

80
00:07:54,47 --> 00:07:58,51
and this is what Lemaitre had speculated about budget earlier but the evidence came in the sixty's

81
00:07:58,52 --> 00:07:59,98
and from the sixty's onward.

82
00:08:00,49 --> 00:08:06,85
You know there were phenomena which required Einstein's theory in order to interpret them properly

83
00:08:07,04 --> 00:08:14,67
and so the theory changed from being rather sort of backwater out of the major theme of physics to being one of the

84
00:08:14,68 --> 00:08:22,3
real front years of theoretical physics I read somewhere in a vigil last. Night.

85
00:08:22,3 --> 00:08:29,2
Fifty five people admired his words as a great piece of art which is something for scientists it's quite a quite a

86
00:08:29,21 --> 00:08:35,22
productive right because you don't want to be a trooper you want to attribute the theory of the world on Universe yes

87
00:08:35,41 --> 00:08:39,00
but it was a good grade piece of creative thinking of course

88
00:08:39,24 --> 00:08:48,45
and there's a lot of discussion about creativity in the sciences versus in the arts of course least creativity in the

89
00:08:48,46 --> 00:08:51,74
arts is more distinctive but in the sciences

90
00:08:51,9 --> 00:08:59,71
and Einstein was more creative in that he made more difference there though in science if they didn't do something B.

91
00:08:59,72 --> 00:09:01,81
Would do it very quickly.

92
00:09:01,81 --> 00:09:05,23
That was to quantum theory right there but not for lack of it is

93
00:09:05,33 --> 00:09:12,01
but in the case of descent relativity if he hadn't done it then the idea would not have the moon which for decades

94
00:09:12,02 --> 00:09:14,35
except I think Project led That's right

95
00:09:14,36 --> 00:09:21,96
and one of my favorite scientific prizes Peter matter what are you going to him because.

96
00:09:21,96 --> 00:09:27,83
It's a great book biologist and he put this rather well he said the difference between the arts

97
00:09:27,84 --> 00:09:35,16
and sciences like this that if you're not doing science then if you don't discover something then someone else will

98
00:09:35,17 --> 00:09:39,49
discover the same thing soon whereas when Wagner was.

99
00:09:39,49 --> 00:09:45,09
In the middle of googling cycle he took ten years off to write Tristan and Meistersingers

100
00:09:45,31 --> 00:09:48,08
and he didn't think anyone that school could not go to Deborah

101
00:09:48,51 --> 00:09:54,57
and said I think there's a difference that in the arts your work is individualistic even though it doesn't last whereas

102
00:09:54,58 --> 00:09:59,98
in the sciences your work is juror is part of some growing edifice but you do.

103
00:10:00,01 --> 00:10:05,12
Is it individuality and if you hadn't done it then someone else would have done differently sued

104
00:10:05,31 --> 00:10:11,43
and Einstein is part of the few exceptions in that he did make a more distinctive imprint in the twentieth century

105
00:10:11,44 --> 00:10:11,83
thousand

106
00:10:11,84 --> 00:10:18,56
and one US All of them are just fascinating sometimes use the metaphor finding the beginning of a roll of scotch tape

107
00:10:18,61 --> 00:10:21,49
you know which is very difficult and then you can unroll it is yes

108
00:10:21,77 --> 00:10:28,13
and so if you think of this been rolling tape particular for cosmology in the river which is now of.

109
00:10:28,13 --> 00:10:37,1
Like a hundred years since Einstein's work on top of it here we have this explosion of results of ideas where are we

110
00:10:37,11 --> 00:10:44,61
sort of say in understanding the big picture do you feel we are just at the beginning we're half way what's your

111
00:10:44,62 --> 00:10:44,94
feeling

112
00:10:45,28 --> 00:10:50,5
but of course there was the beginning of sun you know because as the film does advance their preferred gets longer

113
00:10:50,69 --> 00:10:57,00
and a new set of questions becomes are about understanding the fundamental principles of the universe Yes Well I think

114
00:10:57,01 --> 00:11:01,63
people a huge progress certainly since I was a student forty years ago

115
00:11:02,28 --> 00:11:09,26
when we didn't know if there's a big bang to talk yet one thing we've learned of course is that the universe in the

116
00:11:09,98 --> 00:11:16,88
scales that we can observe does have a certain uniformity yet we've learned that the atoms in a distant galaxy are just

117
00:11:16,89 --> 00:11:22,58
the same as the atoms in the lab with I thought the case of course with the universe was dark it would not make any

118
00:11:22,59 --> 00:11:28,68
progress at all but we've learned about that we've also learned that all the galaxies in the universe

119
00:11:28,69 --> 00:11:35,1
and all the stars can be traced back to a common origin in this hot dense beginning the so-called big bang

120
00:11:35,43 --> 00:11:39,93
and we can now date that to be thirteen point eight billion years ago

121
00:11:40,49 --> 00:11:46,51
and so we can trace out the history of the universe from the hot dense beginning to the present

122
00:11:46,86 --> 00:11:56,00
and we can also understand how from these a wolf it's beginning is the first structure was formed as universe cooled

123
00:11:56,78 --> 00:11:59,98
and condensed into the first galaxies and stuff.

124
00:12:00,18 --> 00:12:03,07
Yes And we have a very good theory for this

125
00:12:03,38 --> 00:12:11,00
and we can actually test the theory a number of ways we can look back with our telescopes to objects so far away

126
00:12:11,14 --> 00:12:14,91
but then I'd set out when universe attentiveness day age

127
00:12:15,14 --> 00:12:21,79
and we have evidence of the much earlier universe from studying in detail the background radiation from the beginning

128
00:12:22,14 --> 00:12:29,32
and you get a very consistent picture going back to when the universe was smooth apart from tiny fluctuations

129
00:12:29,78 --> 00:12:35,73
and to the stage when there is fluctuations of enhanced their density contrast to make again galaxies

130
00:12:36,01 --> 00:12:38,12
and this is a consistent picture

131
00:12:38,16 --> 00:12:44,44
and it also tells us that the universe contains the your the atoms that we know about

132
00:12:44,73 --> 00:12:51,59
and also contains about five times as much stuff in the form of what's called dark matter particles which have no

133
00:12:51,6 --> 00:12:57,88
electric charge to do drak parties move around under gravity we don't know what part because they are they're still a

134
00:12:57,89 --> 00:13:06,46
mystery but we know for sure that the dynamics of galaxies is dominated by this dark matter.

135
00:13:06,46 --> 00:13:14,14
Are you personally surprised that we came so far that we have such a complete picture of.

136
00:13:14,14 --> 00:13:16,79
The universe when you could imagine

137
00:13:16,8 --> 00:13:24,94
or just saw formidable obstacles in learning about all your book as well I think it is it is gratifying a surprising

138
00:13:24,95 --> 00:13:32,56
number of ways first of course we owe the advances ninety five percent to improvements in technology

139
00:13:32,57 --> 00:13:38,99
and intimate Taishan I'm Jenny theory doesn't get you very far by itself though none of us as wise as Einstein would go

140
00:13:39,00 --> 00:13:45,06
further because we had better as you say you believe is on the borders of a theory a very good right so going after

141
00:13:45,07 --> 00:13:51,52
experimental evidence Yes that's right simply because we're there for him to that that's right so we return that

142
00:13:51,67 --> 00:13:59,98
but I think that a more fundamental level what is gratifying is that our minds which haven't changed very much has.

143
00:14:00,43 --> 00:14:05,7
And just as though the African savannah as tens of thousands of years ago.

144
00:14:05,7 --> 00:14:08,73
Can cope not just with the everyday world to be evolved to cope with

145
00:14:08,92 --> 00:14:11,63
but can cope with the counter Jew if one of the quantum

146
00:14:12,28 --> 00:14:19,59
and also of the cosmos so it's surprising that the the world is such that we can understand both the micro

147
00:14:19,72 --> 00:14:24,74
and the cosmic are what we have to get quite understood this has a link those together as you know better than me the

148
00:14:24,75 --> 00:14:32,1
challenge of twenty first century physics is to have a unified theory which combines what Einstein did which gives us a

149
00:14:32,11 --> 00:14:40,24
good picture of the large scale universe and gravity with the quantum world are you optimistic that this will proceed

150
00:14:40,85 --> 00:14:46,13
or you are you expecting at some point it will be a sign for me than for human beings.

151
00:14:46,13 --> 00:14:47,00
Well the fact is

152
00:14:47,26 --> 00:14:53,25
when the you can just far better than me how likely it is that string theory will deliver the goods What is it worth it

153
00:14:53,26 --> 00:15:00,81
will I think it's very good to do some people who believe that this may happen because otherwise it will be motivated

154
00:15:00,82 --> 00:15:06,31
to try different ways of the never succeed so it's very good that there are people including many of our friends

155
00:15:06,32 --> 00:15:13,88
and colleagues call working on ideas of Unified Theory his and I hope they will succeed

156
00:15:13,94 --> 00:15:23,18
but I think we have to be open minded about whether there are deep aspects of reality which are going to be beyond our

157
00:15:23,19 --> 00:15:30,29
capacity to grasp because after all I mean a monkey can't understand quantum theory and that maybe some.

158
00:15:30,29 --> 00:15:38,02
Deep piece of reality which we just can't comprehend as hopeless as monkeys just got there you think that will ever

159
00:15:38,34 --> 00:15:45,48
discovered these things or Dio can almost by definition outside the realm because Mark is probably also not the man

160
00:15:45,49 --> 00:15:50,91
and that they can't understand quantum mechanics Well Lou that's why they went to not aware of these thirty

161
00:15:51,12 --> 00:15:54,22
but the maybe has base of nature which we are not aware of

162
00:15:54,23 --> 00:15:59,91
and that of course may mean that there are discoveries to be left to.

163
00:16:00,49 --> 00:16:06,91
Brains better than ours some kind of push to bring in cities which may come into existence on Earth talk clearly your

164
00:16:06,92 --> 00:16:12,38
business partner amazing you do this is. Human beings on planet Earth.

165
00:16:12,38 --> 00:16:18,93
Looking at the universe do you think there are signs elsewhere in the universe.

166
00:16:18,93 --> 00:16:27,27
Scientists of well of of course what we we don't know I mean I think in big we can say more you know it's that question

167
00:16:27,28 --> 00:16:32,53
and we could have done twenty years ago because one thing we've certainly learnt reaches a great discovery in the last

168
00:16:32,54 --> 00:16:38,6
twenty years is that most of the stars which we see are over to the rich

169
00:16:38,61 --> 00:16:43,23
and use of planets just as the sun is always hit by the earth and the other familiar planets

170
00:16:43,49 --> 00:16:50,17
and it's quite likely that in our Milky Way galaxy there are a billion planets rather like the earth

171
00:16:50,31 --> 00:16:52,85
and ideas in a sense about the size of the earth

172
00:16:53,14 --> 00:16:58,68
and at the distance from their parents star system water can exist neither boiling away

173
00:16:58,69 --> 00:17:05,26
nor stay fairly as comfortable to our kind of life I suppose of habitat

174
00:17:05,3 --> 00:17:09,03
but of course being habitable is not the same as being inhabited

175
00:17:09,37 --> 00:17:14,00
and of course one of the key scientific questions which is not understood yet

176
00:17:14,49 --> 00:17:22,22
and is the origin of life even on Earth I mean we understand how from this simplest organisms over two

177
00:17:22,23 --> 00:17:24,88
and a half billion years or so.

178
00:17:24,88 --> 00:17:27,77
But I was fearful we are apart as emerged

179
00:17:27,92 --> 00:17:36,05
but what is still not understood is the actually origin the transition from complex chemistry to the first metabolizing

180
00:17:36,06 --> 00:17:41,81
replicating structures and that's one of these problems everyone has known is important

181
00:17:42,09 --> 00:17:48,27
but it's been put in the as it were too difficult box at least it's very difficult to say yes

182
00:17:48,28 --> 00:17:54,7
but do you feel this is a problem that it's kind of it's foreseeable that say within the next decade I think it is

183
00:17:54,71 --> 00:17:59,98
necessary yes because I think unlike the past now there are serious people working on it yet.

184
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:02,14
So I'm hopeful of within ten

185
00:18:02,15 --> 00:18:10,56
or twenty years we will understand how that key transition from my chemistry to the first replicating metabolizing

186
00:18:10,81 --> 00:18:15,64
structures happened I think we will understand that because it's no longer thought premature

187
00:18:15,95 --> 00:18:23,22
and so chemists aided by experiments and computer experiments are making progress and of course

188
00:18:23,37 --> 00:18:31,25
when we understand that which of course is an exciting discovery even the most earthbound biologist you'll tell us two

189
00:18:31,26 --> 00:18:38,16
things in Tellus Was it a rare fluke Yes a wood disciplined in some other planet like the earth

190
00:18:38,36 --> 00:18:45,47
or that life originated remarkably fast after the moment a bus crossed really it seems it's a simple life did you

191
00:18:45,48 --> 00:18:51,24
notice cellular took longer and that of course does indicate that it wasn't a rare fluke and did happen

192
00:18:51,82 --> 00:18:54,43
and so we will understand that

193
00:18:54,44 --> 00:19:00,64
but another thing we might understand ten twenty years from now is whether the chemical basis of all life on earth

194
00:19:00,65 --> 00:19:01,12
D.N.A.

195
00:19:01,13 --> 00:19:04,36
and Our and all that is sort of uniquely special

196
00:19:04,68 --> 00:19:11,6
or whether there could be life out there which could be quite different yet yes couldn't even be the same basic life on

197
00:19:11,61 --> 00:19:17,38
Titan just so we would have to have are going to start talking again you're in a position for some of these questions

198
00:19:17,39 --> 00:19:21,79
to be asked and asked whether actually going to build it that's right because

199
00:19:22,51 --> 00:19:29,6
when we can't quite do it yet within ten years we have telescope powerful enough to actually take the spectrum of the

200
00:19:29,61 --> 00:19:37,11
light from a planet around another star and get some feel for is that August in there is the surface green

201
00:19:37,15 --> 00:19:41,42
and things like that so we will learn whether there is vegetation

202
00:19:41,99 --> 00:19:47,75
or life of some kind some kind of footage that is just going on all these other planets around other stars

203
00:19:47,92 --> 00:19:54,66
and that to be a huge discovery and as a scientist you have to you you're very much aware of all the uncertainties

204
00:19:54,72 --> 00:19:59,5
and experiments real problems for you but as a cosmology if you think about a cost.

205
00:20:01,92 --> 00:20:06,27
What your personal god of what I'm saying gut feeling

206
00:20:06,32 --> 00:20:15,8
but your impression intuition you think that the universe is populated. Also with intelligent.

207
00:20:15,8 --> 00:20:22,8
Well I think we know so little looked at so there would be foolish to lay forgive those all the good news is OK

208
00:20:22,98 --> 00:20:29,92
but even that aside I mean I think if you asked me to bet yes I would bet that sort of simple life is probably

209
00:20:29,93 --> 00:20:35,41
widespread but of course going from simple life to.

210
00:20:35,41 --> 00:20:37,9
Life like us which are self-aware

211
00:20:38,27 --> 00:20:46,12
and intelligent we don't know how likely that was because evolution abolishes debate about the contingencies that were

212
00:20:46,13 --> 00:20:52,45
involved in our versions rather then i was depressed critical points for instance and didn't like to go over thirty

213
00:20:52,91 --> 00:20:59,21
but you know that's right and you know if the dinosaurs had been wiped out you know.

214
00:20:59,21 --> 00:21:05,57
In terms of developed somewhere also or what would these contingencies crucial so we did

215
00:21:05,73 --> 00:21:11,86
and if evolution were really run on the earth then would it end up the same or would it in a quite different

216
00:21:12,09 --> 00:21:18,29
and so that's an uncertainty which means that even if the simple life we don't know.

217
00:21:18,29 --> 00:21:24,16
How likely it is attributed Voivod made to became intelligent but then of course there's another question

218
00:21:24,17 --> 00:21:32,63
but one thing which started he does tell us is that the time lying ahead exactly said least as long as the time that

219
00:21:32,64 --> 00:21:38,04
elapsed up till now the sun has been shining for half a billion years

220
00:21:38,31 --> 00:21:44,28
but it will divide six billion before it flares up and go off the inner planets and wipes out

221
00:21:44,29 --> 00:21:45,95
and you know I from anything on earth

222
00:21:46,81 --> 00:21:55,15
and so no stronger could really believe that we humans are the culmination of evolution.

223
00:21:55,15 --> 00:21:59,98
For continuing its continued and I'll be no idea what's going to happen I mean if we if we.

224
00:22:00,01 --> 00:22:06,28
Think of what might happen on the earth and then of course the pessimistic outcome if you wipe ourselves out

225
00:22:06,53 --> 00:22:11,96
but the more optimistic scenario is that the developer continues

226
00:22:12,13 --> 00:22:21,91
but if developer to use beyond humans like us it will be doubling in selection it will be.

227
00:22:21,91 --> 00:22:31,04
Controlled technical technology driven evolution by future developments in gene editing and also cyborgs

228
00:22:31,05 --> 00:22:32,88
and artificial intelligence

229
00:22:32,89 --> 00:22:38,96
and so you talk a little bit about I think your answer very interesting face that our civilization is new technology

230
00:22:38,97 --> 00:22:45,42
was always around yes but you can definitely say no if it's kind of growing.

231
00:22:45,42 --> 00:22:46,88
Exponentially fast

232
00:22:47,35 --> 00:22:55,7
and I want to come to the topic where I feel personally that we are moving away from a phase where we understood

233
00:22:55,71 --> 00:22:58,81
basically the building blocks of matter of life

234
00:22:58,89 --> 00:23:06,68
and perhaps the universe sorts of face where we start kind of rearranging these building blocks right now so you

235
00:23:06,69 --> 00:23:17,37
already mentioned. We understood living organisms but I think now in the lab we try to create parts or perhaps whole.

236
00:23:17,37 --> 00:23:24,17
Living cells and so you feel this is kind of a some sense of phase transition this is a this is a radical change

237
00:23:24,18 --> 00:23:33,15
and I think what did I think that this century is special for a number of reasons it's the first one we could.

238
00:23:33,15 --> 00:23:40,18
Create a species quite different where you now exist it's the first where maybe artificial intelligence you know twenty

239
00:23:40,19 --> 00:23:45,76
contenders and they start to compete with the level of intelligence in the hardware you know scholars

240
00:23:46,38 --> 00:23:48,87
and it's also of course the fifth century

241
00:23:48,88 --> 00:23:58,39
when for the first time life can spread from the Earth to other places in the solar system so this is a special century

242
00:23:58,52 --> 00:23:59,98
even in the cause which.

243
00:24:00,01 --> 00:24:05,27
Perspective where they've been forty five million centuries already since the earth for Earth

244
00:24:05,41 --> 00:24:09,87
and there will be at least that number in the future so this entry is very special

245
00:24:10,35 --> 00:24:17,72
and can you say something about what you see as future developments not in many many centuries

246
00:24:17,73 --> 00:24:23,51
but say France the next next decades because of some of these developments are going incredibly fast

247
00:24:23,87 --> 00:24:33,28
and perhaps we are not even the droplet even aware what is possible right now so for instance thinking bowls of life

248
00:24:33,35 --> 00:24:40,57
and tolerance How do you see this happening in the coming coming years about your parents whether

249
00:24:40,58 --> 00:24:44,06
or not the next person either is topics but if you want free you were right but

250
00:24:44,07 --> 00:24:52,13
but I think it's clear that our understanding of genetics and I belittled to actually synthesize new genomes

251
00:24:52,14 --> 00:24:59,67
and modify existing genomes is developing very fast to the extent it will be possible to always design new species

252
00:24:59,98 --> 00:25:04,02
or design very heavily modified species and adapt our progeny

253
00:25:04,42 --> 00:25:11,47
and that's going to happen in parallel is another quite separate development which is.

254
00:25:11,47 --> 00:25:17,99
That while I was in computers from being just calculating machines to being.

255
00:25:17,99 --> 00:25:24,31
Objects which can undertake what's called generalized machine learning and we've seen developers of this in the book

256
00:25:25,08 --> 00:25:27,13
and they spectacular come well indeed

257
00:25:27,26 --> 00:25:34,94
and of course to think of some key steps in this it's twenty years since a computer be Kasparov the world chess

258
00:25:34,95 --> 00:25:36,59
champion.

259
00:25:36,59 --> 00:25:43,21
And that was done by the program being made by the chess players etc

260
00:25:43,46 --> 00:25:46,39
and the computer could work through minutes of this fast

261
00:25:46,59 --> 00:25:54,32
but for this to be talked tossed a computer directly into your place Where is what happened this year was a computer

262
00:25:54,64 --> 00:25:59,89
beat the world's championship game of government and this is another very challenging game played more the cup.

263
00:26:00,01 --> 00:26:04,24
Played out more challenging yes but the big difference was in this case

264
00:26:04,48 --> 00:26:06,93
and the computer was not programmed to detail

265
00:26:07,49 --> 00:26:14,93
and it was a really good in the general rules then it to it watched hundreds of thousands of games

266
00:26:15,09 --> 00:26:22,25
and then played against itself had got better so the people who devised the program they didn't understand why it made

267
00:26:22,26 --> 00:26:25,78
some particular clever moves which in a bid to beat the world champion

268
00:26:25,97 --> 00:26:32,93
and so this is an example where the computer is sort of teaching itself by being able to crunch huge amounts of data

269
00:26:33,24 --> 00:26:42,23
and just the same like translation is now done not by giving the computer the details of the cabaret and syntax

270
00:26:42,44 --> 00:26:45,88
but by getting it to read it read millions of pages

271
00:26:45,89 --> 00:26:51,7
and then if they give major pages of European Union documents of different languages it never gets bored it just means

272
00:26:51,71 --> 00:26:58,48
all of these kind of eventually are learned to translate a perfect circle so that the thought That's right so this is

273
00:26:58,49 --> 00:27:03,98
generally considered it is very worried about the fact that these machines will be people that go on

274
00:27:04,26 --> 00:27:13,2
or in language skills they're basically not able to tell us how did it it's what I mean they do not able to instruct us

275
00:27:13,21 --> 00:27:16,58
they just it does probably learn how to do this

276
00:27:16,59 --> 00:27:21,94
and then the fact that the way a child learns to speak a language you have ever considered language

277
00:27:21,95 --> 00:27:28,26
when you're not able to write out a grammar Yes yes I'm worried about the machines are doing more

278
00:27:28,27 --> 00:27:35,58
and more of that stuff between extremely convenient that they're kind of autonomous that they just go to wrong ways

279
00:27:35,7 --> 00:27:40,41
well I think there is a worry because there's some things which are they they will be able to do better in humans like

280
00:27:40,42 --> 00:27:41,17
a will

281
00:27:41,18 --> 00:27:48,58
but already the the way the cost of hedge funds steer money Office price by being able to analyze more data to the

282
00:27:48,59 --> 00:27:51,84
human being can and of course that's going to get better

283
00:27:51,85 --> 00:27:58,57
and better as they can see tiny coloration related marketers of our witnesses that's rather let me do that already

284
00:27:58,58 --> 00:28:08,24
but they do it or to go to. Said that but I think we got to bear in mind that I'm still they don't really have.

285
00:28:08,24 --> 00:28:13,95
Human level general to intensity do some things and of course.

286
00:28:13,95 --> 00:28:22,00
The whole point is that robots are still clumsy I mean they know they can move around the piece on the real chessboard

287
00:28:22,13 --> 00:28:28,42
well as a child can there's a long way to go before a machines can actually walk you tried the external world of the

288
00:28:28,43 --> 00:28:30,34
likes of this.

289
00:28:30,34 --> 00:28:39,17
Game going between going to dreaded that the fifth game actually was wrong by the Gore campaign because he felt.

290
00:28:39,17 --> 00:28:45,83
I'm not going to be required to do some crazy stuff so if you have to be a good something so this fifth game might be

291
00:28:45,84 --> 00:28:53,17
something some pop rocks the unique human quality well of that's right it's a human's is more flexible and

292
00:28:54,16 --> 00:28:57,23
and of course there are many things which.

293
00:28:57,23 --> 00:28:58,00
She's can do

294
00:28:58,08 --> 00:29:06,76
but of course the problem with understand that it's going to be to ensure that machines have common sense because there

295
00:29:06,77 --> 00:29:17,53
are many things that we we understand. About the world friends I was told that the. Computer to beat in the.

296
00:29:17,53 --> 00:29:21,09
The American champion it is.

297
00:29:21,09 --> 00:29:27,84
To a good game and oh did you go call jeopardy which was yes yes and I did know this game

298
00:29:27,85 --> 00:29:31,6
but it just isn't less might just that most computer did those to T.V.

299
00:29:31,61 --> 00:29:36,82
Games but it was asked a question which is big enough the shoe box all down to Everest

300
00:29:36,86 --> 00:29:43,12
and couldn't say I'm going to see it it has no significance if you're going to be able to pick who should block it yes

301
00:29:43,29 --> 00:29:45,84
it had no conception of their day world

302
00:29:46,00 --> 00:29:53,69
and another simple example it's given is that if you have a one of these robots in your home which is supposed to sort

303
00:29:53,7 --> 00:29:59,69
of make sure that your fridge is stored up and the heating is on the food for you when you come home you know.

304
00:30:00,21 --> 00:30:07,8
If it's the life of meat it may put the cat in the other no you know because it may have realized that the turn this

305
00:30:07,81 --> 00:30:12,32
other thing was not appropriate and so one of the chicken in the office for yes

306
00:30:12,33 --> 00:30:21,56
but right so one of the issues really for the people developing here is to ensure that it does learn what human ethics

307
00:30:21,57 --> 00:30:28,99
and human attitudes are and which it tells us to be able to learn that those sorts of things as I know one guy

308
00:30:29,00 --> 00:30:35,32
or a cusp are of course ask you know boy yes he lost this game is just a game against a computer that's you know it's

309
00:30:35,33 --> 00:30:38,08
not man against machine but he said well it's me

310
00:30:38,12 --> 00:30:45,73
and the machine to against somebody else so yes there's some sense is there is that a better image in our mind that we

311
00:30:45,74 --> 00:30:47,94
should kind of start to collaborate with these machines

312
00:30:48,13 --> 00:30:54,65
and I think so because I think Casper says that the human plus a machine Yes that is best

313
00:30:54,8 --> 00:31:00,23
and I think that's going to be to happen but there's are these nightmare scenarios of the machines taking over

314
00:31:00,24 --> 00:31:10,82
and of course the kind of thing which I think is not too futuristic is if we have a system of the city where all the

315
00:31:10,86 --> 00:31:17,26
public services and the transport is controlled in some small way and the whole thing could go wrong

316
00:31:17,27 --> 00:31:23,55
and so we're very vulnerable and one of the downsides of course of all these developments and indeed of the debate

317
00:31:23,56 --> 00:31:29,9
and interconnected world is that we are more vulnerable because everything is interconnected just to go there any

318
00:31:29,91 --> 00:31:30,46
moment

319
00:31:31,43 --> 00:31:39,79
but if you think about this issue of we talk about nature of our money origins of life here comes back up Aleutian Yes

320
00:31:40,14 --> 00:31:45,88
Now when developing technology to us again from a cosmic perspective.

321
00:31:45,88 --> 00:31:49,91
Is there do you see a difference between what nature is doing what we're doing

322
00:31:50,74 --> 00:31:57,6
and where I think in the sense we're to we're going to take over from nature because if we think of what may happen not

323
00:31:57,61 --> 00:32:08,01
to next fifty years but maybe next. Two or three hundred years then it may well be that she women's.

324
00:32:08,01 --> 00:32:17,17
Need to sort of cyborgs or become or that the electronic machines take over completely because obviously.

325
00:32:17,17 --> 00:32:23,48
They don't have all the features of the human brain but they have the advance of speed compared to the human brain

326
00:32:23,7 --> 00:32:29,2
and so it could be that the future will lie with.

327
00:32:29,2 --> 00:32:33,83
Electronic machines not organic creatures like us

328
00:32:33,98 --> 00:32:41,41
and I personally think if you ask me my most likely scenario for the next hundred years I think that.

329
00:32:41,41 --> 00:32:48,72
The they will be in a hundred years a few people living on Mars and there be people who.

330
00:32:48,72 --> 00:32:53,35
Will adventurers that have to cope with a hostile.

331
00:32:53,35 --> 00:32:54,05
Climate

332
00:32:54,09 --> 00:33:02,94
and invade conditions only question bookstores yes right that day in the environment for which their bodies are ill

333
00:33:02,95 --> 00:33:03,61
adapted

334
00:33:03,92 --> 00:33:11,95
and I think they will use all the technology will then have to adapt to that new environment where that would be by

335
00:33:12,25 --> 00:33:16,42
Cibo techniques by downloading their brain dead to machine or something like that

336
00:33:16,59 --> 00:33:24,5
and I think it will happen there because we're probably going to want to control for ethical potential reasons the

337
00:33:25,49 --> 00:33:32,56
adoption of these technology here on Earth where it is if you have these people beyond the range of any such regulation

338
00:33:32,69 --> 00:33:33,75
the good wishes and good luck

339
00:33:33,76 --> 00:33:40,61
and no good listening Good to be administered I might buy my scenario would be that within a few hundred years there

340
00:33:40,62 --> 00:33:42,23
will be.

341
00:33:42,23 --> 00:33:51,27
Entities who call post humans in that they were very different from our so they'd be a new species and if they are.

342
00:33:51,27 --> 00:33:51,98
Electronic

343
00:33:51,99 --> 00:33:57,53
and not organic then of course they may not want to be on the planet at all they may be happy a hundred zero gravity

344
00:33:57,54 --> 00:33:59,95
somewhere else and as an analogy the future.

345
00:34:00,25 --> 00:34:04,36
And so if you then think in terms of the cosmic perspective of time

346
00:34:04,95 --> 00:34:13,88
when there are millions of centuries ahead then the way things were looking is that we had forty five million centuries

347
00:34:14,85 --> 00:34:23,63
and then for a few tens or hundreds of centuries organic civilization evolved developed technology

348
00:34:24,05 --> 00:34:31,96
and then it was taken over by Sheen and they have been billions of years billions of centuries ahead

349
00:34:32,1 --> 00:34:39,67
and so this has an implication also if we are thinking it might be intelligent life elsewhere and universe

350
00:34:39,68 --> 00:34:44,16
and I think as I said I think them for the simple life but it is in terms of life will be

351
00:34:44,46 --> 00:34:50,66
and I think if we detect any kind of evidence for something artificial.

352
00:34:50,66 --> 00:35:00,22
Beyond our solar system then it is more likely to be these machines because if the evolution on this other planet

353
00:35:00,72 --> 00:35:04,71
attract what happened on the earth then it's allowed to be synchronized

354
00:35:05,08 --> 00:35:10,4
and if their ability is behind them the best because the we know we have some sense where nature

355
00:35:10,41 --> 00:35:16,61
and technology are we're going to say that that's right so which is our current Yes Currently that's right it's if it

356
00:35:16,65 --> 00:35:24,05
if they're behind us then to be no evidence for any technology if they're ahead of us then they will have got way into

357
00:35:24,06 --> 00:35:32,66
this machine age and so I think it would be unlikely that we would detect any other.

358
00:35:32,66 --> 00:35:39,81
External Intelligence which is anywhere like us so I think the normal talk about you know these

359
00:35:40,69 --> 00:35:47,74
and aliens who are sort of by page with his own storks Maybe you heard that that's not realistic on the story yet this

360
00:35:47,75 --> 00:35:57,18
face the truth currently is just the face of the evolution of life which is necessary to spread from planet earth

361
00:35:57,97 --> 00:36:06,44
through the universe. We really it's only through technology that we can actually really spread around the.

362
00:36:06,44 --> 00:36:15,87
Dr because clearly it as humans we're not adapted to do long voyages goes if your machine near immortal then these long

363
00:36:15,88 --> 00:36:23,08
distance voyages if you want to make them are going to be possible but of course this leads to another.

364
00:36:23,08 --> 00:36:32,93
Point the famous family paradox on Earth which is that if indeed life on earth was not unique then why haven't we seen

365
00:36:32,94 --> 00:36:39,49
evidence for the avian she's had a head start over us and if it indeed is a serious constraint

366
00:36:39,5 --> 00:36:48,82
and just does lead me to suspect that perhaps intelligent life is is rare and if that's the case of course then it.

367
00:36:48,82 --> 00:36:54,62
Makes what happens here on earth even more important because it to the Master us as human beings

368
00:36:54,87 --> 00:36:59,13
but it could because between Porton because in this century.

369
00:36:59,13 --> 00:37:03,96
What happens will determine whether life takes its next step

370
00:37:03,97 --> 00:37:11,72
and jump starts pushed human evolution away from the earth and in organic form or whether we sort of snuff things out

371
00:37:11,73 --> 00:37:13,25
or go back to the Stone Age

372
00:37:14,04 --> 00:37:24,72
and that would foreclose these potentials for what might happen in the far future market thinking about this.

373
00:37:24,72 --> 00:37:28,67
Phase technology is becoming more important to market even picking

374
00:37:28,68 --> 00:37:37,97
or taking over what we do here how do you see this from the point of evolution is there's another source face you know

375
00:37:38,1 --> 00:37:44,52
which is a different God because we've evolved from simple life through doubling in selection here over three

376
00:37:44,53 --> 00:37:50,06
and a half billion years but because the human beings that we need selection has stopped anyway

377
00:37:50,3 --> 00:37:55,95
but future evolution will be technological it will be through border find the genome

378
00:37:56,21 --> 00:37:59,98
and cyber technology of only plug into machines etc and so.

379
00:38:00,36 --> 00:38:04,53
This will happen in a directed way on the technological time scale

380
00:38:04,74 --> 00:38:12,79
and therefore much faster because Darwinian selection takes about a million years for a species to form of all of them

381
00:38:12,8 --> 00:38:21,28
go extinct Where is the changes to the manatee and the emergence of post humans could take just centuries.

382
00:38:21,28 --> 00:38:28,49
Talk about centuries you wrote a book with a tart all our final century effect I think in the U.K.

383
00:38:28,5 --> 00:38:37,08
It was a final hour ordeal rather ordinary round saw looks like it's like that of a case of the person in our hour

384
00:38:37,13 --> 00:38:39,08
but it's.

385
00:38:39,08 --> 00:38:48,4
You dirty you talked about the dangers that are coming with these rapid developments yes in technology can you say

386
00:38:48,41 --> 00:38:50,47
something about what you see as the dangers

387
00:38:50,48 --> 00:38:57,33
and why is this particular century this twenty first century so crucial is where I think the two kinds of dangers which

388
00:38:57,34 --> 00:39:05,79
are new to us this century One is that we are collectively putting greater pressures on the environment he said war of

389
00:39:05,8 --> 00:39:14,55
those each of us more demanding in energy resources nets why we worry about climate change. Loss of biodiversity.

390
00:39:14,55 --> 00:39:21,46
And issues like that is that dangerous to the planet of course a dangerous to us it's dangerous to us I mean not to the

391
00:39:21,47 --> 00:39:23,94
planet suppose apart the drivers of life yes

392
00:39:24,11 --> 00:39:29,38
but maybe depleted state because if if by diversity is reduced it will be a less exciting

393
00:39:29,58 --> 00:39:35,09
but I'm using that cells are going to get massive extinct Yes that's right so they have to start again from the States

394
00:39:35,29 --> 00:39:42,25
so one class a threat to those we are causing connectedly But the other kind which I focused on a bit more than a book

395
00:39:42,6 --> 00:39:43,89
are the threats that

396
00:39:44,16 --> 00:39:52,42
and the search for the powerful technologies which empower individual small groups of course we had the nuclear weapons

397
00:39:52,43 --> 00:39:57,44
or to the outcome of the twentieth century technology which of course changed some global political scene

398
00:39:58,15 --> 00:39:59,98
but it was also pretty close to.

399
00:40:00,01 --> 00:40:06,9
Call it a very close call yes you will remember this is not obvious that we would survive to go absolutely true just as

400
00:40:06,91 --> 00:40:14,65
a McNamara said they were lucky as well as wise at the time of Cuba yes and then we might be less likely less time

401
00:40:14,82 --> 00:40:20,52
and of course that threat is just it a balance because we could imagine a new standoff between new super powers

402
00:40:20,53 --> 00:40:24,49
and had less Luckily than the Cooper crisis so that's one threat

403
00:40:24,5 --> 00:40:32,69
but I think twenty first century technology is faces with new threats in particular about biotechnology because

404
00:40:33,55 --> 00:40:38,35
biotechnology of course is very powerful but we could never age the genome

405
00:40:38,54 --> 00:40:44,18
and this article gave the function technology where you can make that influenza virus more virulent

406
00:40:44,19 --> 00:40:52,5
and more transmissible and these techniques a widely understood by hacking is even a student sport in some places

407
00:40:53,1 --> 00:41:00,02
and they don't need to shoot special purpose facilities so where is it you can monitor the misuse of nuclear technology

408
00:41:00,61 --> 00:41:02,21
you can't make an H.

409
00:41:02,22 --> 00:41:07,24
Bomb you know garrote as it were and it's very hard to monitor the misuse of bio and cyber

410
00:41:07,44 --> 00:41:11,63
and that's what worries me that by air all by terror then a small group

411
00:41:11,64 --> 00:41:19,27
or even an individual could call cause of sort of global disaster what about the whole realm of information

412
00:41:19,33 --> 00:41:26,9
and where we share information our communication technology perhaps also intelligence that works because what you feel

413
00:41:27,06 --> 00:41:33,85
well what we're vulnerable of course because we depend on global networks all of our manufacturing etc in this

414
00:41:33,86 --> 00:41:39,87
financial system etc And we know that cyber attacks can already be very serious police

415
00:41:40,09 --> 00:41:46,61
and that's going to be aggravated I think is time time goes on as we become warm water pendent on the information

416
00:41:46,62 --> 00:41:47,11
technology

417
00:41:47,12 --> 00:41:54,26
and networks you feel we are in a certain kind of arms race with technology between kind of the good in the bad because

418
00:41:54,27 --> 00:41:59,98
just because many of these issues you mention need again technology to control really.

419
00:42:00,01 --> 00:42:01,78
They do indeed it's a kind of arms race

420
00:42:01,99 --> 00:42:08,72
and I think the the why I have is that it's not obvious that the good side is going to win

421
00:42:08,96 --> 00:42:16,1
and I think we can predict unfortunately a growing tension between.

422
00:42:16,1 --> 00:42:21,58
Freedom previously and security yes if we are to avoid the misuse

423
00:42:21,59 --> 00:42:28,38
and I worry not so much about all the NY state actors as about individual disaffected groups

424
00:42:28,62 --> 00:42:37,37
and my worst nightmare for instance would be someone who was an ecology fanatic who thought to Toobin human beings in

425
00:42:37,38 --> 00:42:37,97
the world

426
00:42:38,33 --> 00:42:44,92
and someone with those acids combined with fanaticism might say well let's cut down the number who make the world by

427
00:42:44,93 --> 00:42:52,8
releasing some engineer virus perfectly this is feasible this is really feeling you know yes you feel sort of the risk

428
00:42:53,19 --> 00:42:58,93
because it's a purely technological matter roaster also some kind of a moral dimension.

429
00:42:58,93 --> 00:43:03,39
But obviously we it would be immoral to do anything like that

430
00:43:03,93 --> 00:43:14,84
but maybe they're also a scientist Yes Well I think of obviously has politicians have an extra incentive to minimize

431
00:43:14,85 --> 00:43:17,5
the number of disaffected people with grievances

432
00:43:17,75 --> 00:43:25,89
or just the kind of people who do this so the challenge for politicians is much greater because a small minority which

433
00:43:25,9 --> 00:43:31,31
could be overwhelmed by traditional power and the kind of course fight back using these technologies

434
00:43:31,32 --> 00:43:40,13
and I think this is a real problem but as regards what scientists can do a search on I think scientists.

435
00:43:40,13 --> 00:43:44,8
They're not tremendously wise forecasters always but they can look ahead a bit and warm

436
00:43:45,04 --> 00:43:51,56
and foresee what are going to be the threats you didn't book I would thirty years ago I did stood up quite well you

437
00:43:51,57 --> 00:43:56,33
know in that sense but I think we can for see what the facts are going to be

438
00:43:56,52 --> 00:43:59,82
and perhaps distinguish better than they people.

439
00:44:00,11 --> 00:44:05,16
Between what is science fiction and what is something we need to worry about in just catching scenarios

440
00:44:05,41 --> 00:44:07,72
but also taking the next step

441
00:44:08,03 --> 00:44:16,94
and perhaps try to convince people to take a certain direction Well I think it's going to finish people are politicians

442
00:44:17,11 --> 00:44:25,23
and and here again I think we've got to think that scientists have an advantage because their work is more global

443
00:44:25,86 --> 00:44:32,16
or they're more international even in the depths of the Cold War whether there were fairly open links between some of

444
00:44:32,17 --> 00:44:40,66
these on either side of him curtain said science is a global culture which transcends all the barriers of faith

445
00:44:40,67 --> 00:44:47,65
and nationality more easily than other cultures so we have that advantage and we share common attitudes

446
00:44:48,56 --> 00:44:50,8
and we can advise our governments

447
00:44:51,01 --> 00:44:58,76
but I think you've got to bear in mind that most of the decisions which politicians have to take.

448
00:44:58,76 --> 00:45:03,09
Involve some science whether they are energy health environment etc

449
00:45:03,3 --> 00:45:09,87
but they're not just science I don't have to combine the various components a little to do this is that that's right

450
00:45:09,88 --> 00:45:15,29
and of course all those other components some of this is just citizens that most special like to be heard

451
00:45:15,61 --> 00:45:18,76
and that's why I think it's very important that.

452
00:45:18,76 --> 00:45:24,35
All citizens should have enough feeling for science and probability

453
00:45:24,36 --> 00:45:29,43
and risk of things like that so they can't be bamboozled too easily about experts

454
00:45:29,66 --> 00:45:35,62
and that they could take part in the debate if you look at this kind of conversation between science and society

455
00:45:35,67 --> 00:45:39,87
and you might argue even looking back on two thousand

456
00:45:39,88 --> 00:45:48,48
and sixteen it was not such a good year for reasons rights are so are we losing the debate.

457
00:45:48,48 --> 00:45:53,39
I'm not sure I think a child is getting harder but I think.

458
00:45:53,39 --> 00:46:03,41
In an issue where science is an important components like climate change. And G. Policy health.

459
00:46:03,41 --> 00:46:07,4
Usage and ethics I think we're doing not too badly

460
00:46:07,41 --> 00:46:14,24
but I think the important thing to realize is that scientists can't themselves decide

461
00:46:14,36 --> 00:46:21,62
and here scientists could probably have more influence not by talking directly to a politician or minister

462
00:46:21,91 --> 00:46:28,21
but through in food to the public consensus because politicians they could dismiss experts

463
00:46:28,32 --> 00:46:33,88
but they can't so easily dismiss something which in the press every day which is in the inbox every day from the public

464
00:46:33,94 --> 00:46:41,79
so you've probably got Mark I think is the public at large is a prerequisite for the Sultan is a dish used to stay on

465
00:46:41,8 --> 00:46:47,73
the agenda especially when they're long term and global like climate change

466
00:46:47,74 --> 00:46:51,89
and environmental energy so I think that's crucially important and

467
00:46:52,63 --> 00:47:00,96
and I think if the public doesn't understand the basics of science then this debate card when you get beyond slogans

468
00:47:01,22 --> 00:47:08,26
and the public are really be informed citizens who feel that we also should be able to share some of the values of

469
00:47:08,27 --> 00:47:10,22
science and.

470
00:47:10,22 --> 00:47:18,64
Actually what are the values of so for you personally but of course the values are fairly limited in the sense.

471
00:47:18,64 --> 00:47:19,18
Of a stake

472
00:47:19,19 --> 00:47:28,83
and curiosity etc So I don't think the very values which scientist needs to have which are the also the modded of other

473
00:47:28,84 --> 00:47:37,47
professionals but I think in science there is this tradition of transnational contacts and open debate

474
00:47:37,69 --> 00:47:42,25
and willingness to be proved wrong and I think we should encourage those issues

475
00:47:42,36 --> 00:47:50,73
and also a feeling of probabilities because one of the difficulties in public discourse is a people the stigmas read

476
00:47:50,74 --> 00:47:54,05
something which is so unlikely that it's not worth worrying about

477
00:47:54,34 --> 00:47:59,98
and things which are worth worrying about because even if I'd likely they are so catastrophic.

478
00:48:00,01 --> 00:48:06,2
If they happen that we need to be concerned about so one thing I'm personally worried about is there's kind of this

479
00:48:06,21 --> 00:48:10,53
paradox that when science or technology is progressing we learn more

480
00:48:10,54 --> 00:48:14,36
and more the things we learn are kind of quite detailed and technical

481
00:48:14,37 --> 00:48:21,31
but almost by definition you're because they're new good yes not easy to understand that are on the other hand all the

482
00:48:21,32 --> 00:48:23,75
applications of science are more

483
00:48:23,76 --> 00:48:31,19
and more in our life so more science in the one hand it's kind of moving away from us because of increased complexity

484
00:48:31,2 --> 00:48:38,19
Yes all the other hand it's coming closer because of its relevance yes for how do we deal with it how can we make

485
00:48:38,2 --> 00:48:45,1
people understand science if on the other hand only a few individuals might a tree fully understand all the details

486
00:48:45,11 --> 00:48:46,95
just well I think with difficulty

487
00:48:46,96 --> 00:48:54,38
but I think it's not quite that bad because even though undetected details the mathematics it's after some of the

488
00:48:54,39 --> 00:49:02,6
sounds we do is very hard for the special to understand I think it is possible to get over the key ideas fairly free of

489
00:49:02,61 --> 00:49:08,24
technicalities I think we can do a master of this we want to do all of them whether you'd really be tried it is

490
00:49:08,25 --> 00:49:08,74
difficult

491
00:49:08,75 --> 00:49:16,03
and in fact it's more difficult people realize because you have to obviously avoid too much mathematics Yes

492
00:49:16,59 --> 00:49:20,22
and you have to avoid technical words not one hundred percent truth

493
00:49:20,53 --> 00:49:25,35
and you very difficult to be almost predictable just like That's right yes Jerry result yes but

494
00:49:25,36 --> 00:49:29,77
but you can you got to simplify obviously but hopefully in almost way

495
00:49:29,78 --> 00:49:36,96
and as I still bore said use of a thing the simplest possible to supply and that's that's a good earth

496
00:49:36,97 --> 00:49:42,75
but I think from my own experience of doing this I think about is to understand you've got to avoid mathematics

497
00:49:42,92 --> 00:49:48,99
and technical words as well particularly difficult thing to avoid which is every day words been used in a special

498
00:49:49,00 --> 00:49:51,94
context and there were two examples one is do

499
00:49:51,95 --> 00:49:59,17
or degenerate Yes which we know has a particular meaning in an exact Magic's going on more likely it is resident.

500
00:49:59,17 --> 00:49:59,98
In America to meet.

501
00:50:00,19 --> 00:50:05,5
But magic does a technical meaning and earth night is a degenerate case of a tribal cetera that's what

502
00:50:05,64 --> 00:50:15,96
and another example which comes up in climate change is. Its feedback because if you want to say that.

503
00:50:15,96 --> 00:50:20,32
As the earth warms they may release at least to him from the tundra

504
00:50:20,62 --> 00:50:26,94
and in this image thing is a positive feedback user with positive feedback with the most people positive feedback

505
00:50:27,17 --> 00:50:32,82
sounds like what happens after you've had a job appraisal come out well as opposed to feedback sounds good three dog is

506
00:50:32,83 --> 00:50:38,28
a great deal so that's an example of where the technical phrase kept in this understood so we got to be careful about

507
00:50:38,38 --> 00:50:45,06
avoiding using everyday words in a sentence which is a different from the like a member of the person comes out

508
00:50:45,07 --> 00:50:51,1
negative just as a good figure is that's right that's right yes so all are talking about a kind of science

509
00:50:51,11 --> 00:51:00,37
and being a scientist. What would you say your some of the qualities successful qualities that the.

510
00:51:00,37 --> 00:51:07,61
What are some of the qualities that a scientist should have for can yes.

511
00:51:07,61 --> 00:51:13,53
Well obviously the ability to understand some technical details or certain metamathematical skill

512
00:51:13,54 --> 00:51:17,91
and now of course computer skills as well.

513
00:51:17,91 --> 00:51:23,26
But also I suppose the motive to try and understand something

514
00:51:23,27 --> 00:51:26,57
and accept that most of your ideas are going to be wrong

515
00:51:27,09 --> 00:51:34,25
and also accept that there are some problems which you will never solve I think one of the differences between

516
00:51:34,87 --> 00:51:38,27
laypeople and experts is that.

517
00:51:38,27 --> 00:51:44,57
They people don't realize that some problems are really too difficult to some I mean and.

518
00:51:44,57 --> 00:51:52,13
The balance between was easy it was difficult it was surprising we are I would give an example my own field just on me

519
00:51:52,7 --> 00:51:59,98
that I expect people to believe me if I tell them about what happens when two black holes a billion law.

520
00:52:00,06 --> 00:52:04,43
She has a way to libel each other and that Margaret got evidence for that

521
00:52:05,12 --> 00:52:10,08
but on the other hand you are foolish to believe any expert of child care

522
00:52:10,09 --> 00:52:14,35
or diet which I think that everyone has a part.

523
00:52:14,35 --> 00:52:15,28
Of the understands

524
00:52:15,81 --> 00:52:24,35
and that's because it's a fallacy to think that every day problems are the easy problems of the hardest problem

525
00:52:24,36 --> 00:52:29,73
but as he did with human beings is far harder to understand than any things in the an inanimate world

526
00:52:30,31 --> 00:52:37,1
and it's a fallacy to think that they need to understand just like people sometimes say that.

527
00:52:37,1 --> 00:52:41,82
It should be easier to cut cure the common cold and other diseases just because it's common

528
00:52:41,83 --> 00:52:47,73
but that doesn't mean it's a people that have a feeling for what the what can be done about carbon

529
00:52:47,96 --> 00:52:55,71
and of course one of the facts of being a scientist is to choose a topic to work on which is not trivial

530
00:52:55,97 --> 00:53:03,48
nor the other harmed so intractability would make any progress at all to talk about the motivation of scientists I

531
00:53:03,49 --> 00:53:09,93
think these motivations come in. Various kind of flavors.

532
00:53:09,93 --> 00:53:15,74
Some people want to understand what I wanted to change it or how do you see this.

533
00:53:15,74 --> 00:53:22,01
But I think if you would believe this yes we want to change the world but our understanding is separate from that

534
00:53:22,13 --> 00:53:28,3
but I think among scientists there is a great variety of Maine to typeset

535
00:53:28,66 --> 00:53:35,64
and I've been surprised by this because you know my professional life like yours is lived among a fairly homogeneous

536
00:53:35,65 --> 00:53:38,68
group paedos although with many common interests

537
00:53:38,69 --> 00:53:45,86
but even among them I think we see quite a variety of personality types on in those who think pictorially

538
00:53:46,32 --> 00:53:51,11
and those who think it is a question was those who like computers and who did like computers

539
00:53:51,38 --> 00:53:59,95
and also those who like to solve problems in a sort of step by step piecemeal way and those who are happy to sort of.

540
00:54:00,32 --> 00:54:09,9
I think in a war open ended well a lot of the government all of imagination in science.

541
00:54:09,9 --> 00:54:12,48
I think imagination is crucial

542
00:54:12,49 --> 00:54:19,34
but it's it's sort of constrained imagination is not it's not quite like art which perhaps is rather like sort of

543
00:54:19,56 --> 00:54:25,11
composing in a few or writing a sonnet where you're trying to do so they created within a standard form

544
00:54:25,4 --> 00:54:29,27
and so science is something where.

545
00:54:29,27 --> 00:54:34,96
Any idea has to be embedded in the huge edifice already built up by your predecessors

546
00:54:35,09 --> 00:54:39,48
but clearly you've got to make some insights.

547
00:54:39,48 --> 00:54:42,47
And unless you make some new insight then

548
00:54:42,78 --> 00:54:49,47
or you do is going to add something which anyone else could have done as well you find certain scientists the

549
00:54:49,48 --> 00:54:57,23
creativity and the straitjacket Yes Yes What about Plague playfulness Well I think that is part of it

550
00:54:57,24 --> 00:55:05,04
and you know I think find it also said that you could keep some childhood instinct alive and if I think of

551
00:55:05,61 --> 00:55:12,18
when most creative scientist I know who is Roger Penrose he's a good example of someone who are.

552
00:55:12,18 --> 00:55:18,79
Things very visually things not only deeper than the rest of us but Mall differently more pictorial most of us

553
00:55:19,05 --> 00:55:27,19
and that he's an example of someone who's recreations of being creative in thinking of his tiling and had taken

554
00:55:27,2 --> 00:55:30,68
or quasar Crystal patterns and also he

555
00:55:31,55 --> 00:55:42,11
and his father who was a psychologist invented is impossible figures which inspired Esha who were already new to devise

556
00:55:42,12 --> 00:55:49,85
of his new Her new dogs in the end the staircase etc So Penrose example someone who you can't really weak without

557
00:55:49,91 --> 00:55:50,58
recognizing

558
00:55:50,59 --> 00:55:58,11
or someone who is specially created in a sort of playful way as well as obviously very deep way I think this film is

559
00:55:58,12 --> 00:55:59,72
called Divine Stein basically.

560
00:56:00,14 --> 00:56:05,36
The fact that imagination is more important than knowledge because imagination is capturing everything that is yet to

561
00:56:05,37 --> 00:56:14,62
be know that's how you feel do you feel that the some sense we also have to be on make aware of the opportunity to

562
00:56:14,63 --> 00:56:22,21
understand something that we that are certain questions that perhaps not current generations aren't even aware is a

563
00:56:22,22 --> 00:56:23,31
question that could be answered

564
00:56:23,58 --> 00:56:31,34
but I think that's true that you've got to be aware that some problems which have become tractable and become timely

565
00:56:31,89 --> 00:56:36,31
and work on them but at the same time you don't need to work on something which is impossible

566
00:56:36,51 --> 00:56:38,62
but I think one thing which has happened

567
00:56:38,66 --> 00:56:47,91
and this is perhaps something which is a downside of being a scientist is that science has become a much larger

568
00:56:47,92 --> 00:56:51,34
enterprise with more mixed motives involved

569
00:56:51,62 --> 00:56:58,47
and the number of new insights the setting not going up in proportion to the number of people who would call themselves

570
00:56:58,48 --> 00:57:03,68
scientists and that's partly because science. Is.

571
00:57:03,68 --> 00:57:11,44
Becoming more tactical more detail leader bigger equipment etc The partly also because there was a commercial precious

572
00:57:11,45 --> 00:57:19,42
It's etter so it makes a diff What if your social elements to it I think these days I think you can probably argue that

573
00:57:19,43 --> 00:57:25,73
being a scientist is much more well interconnectivity of science

574
00:57:25,74 --> 00:57:32,31
and the fact that collaboration's are becoming larger Do you see there another development.

575
00:57:32,31 --> 00:57:37,38
But of course the type of science which is done if you're in a big team is different

576
00:57:37,68 --> 00:57:44,98
and you know it's certainly true that many people who have been regional scientists worked in the party who say this

577
00:57:44,99 --> 00:57:52,14
subject they would not like to be part of the group at CERN way a lot of a thousand people are working the biggest

578
00:57:52,15 --> 00:57:55,17
government and I know that's a quasar industrial organization

579
00:57:55,43 --> 00:57:59,98
and I think one has to warm young people that if they want.

580
00:58:00,01 --> 00:58:06,88
Do sounds they've got to realize that some kind of scientists like being in the industry we some of the downsides

581
00:58:07,23 --> 00:58:11,04
without some of the benefits where is some allows you to be more individual

582
00:58:11,05 --> 00:58:20,01
and to make up your own reputation independent of what are the big global elements you know you're in the Vatican are

583
00:58:20,39 --> 00:58:23,4
but you have colleagues all over the world.

584
00:58:23,4 --> 00:58:30,3
There actually are some kind of converging convergence happening if you look at science across the globe where I think

585
00:58:30,8 --> 00:58:38,37
they've been eyeing changes that science has been done more globally I mean used to be done mainly and North America

586
00:58:38,38 --> 00:58:44,73
and Europe where is now that the rise of science in Asia and other parts of the world is surely benign

587
00:58:44,74 --> 00:58:54,18
and I think we will be missed except that the again many of the Western world which is exist for four hundred years is

588
00:58:54,19 --> 00:58:59,16
going to do it because it's going to be a nation that the world's economic

589
00:58:59,17 --> 00:59:04,05
and intellectual capital going to be concentrated from now on and so it's going to get the global

590
00:59:04,23 --> 00:59:10,39
but of course all of the problems which science needs to tackle are they often go with problems

591
00:59:10,95 --> 00:59:17,19
and so it's very appropriate that scientists should collaborator people all across the world in dealing with that

592
00:59:17,23 --> 00:59:18,4
energy resources

593
00:59:18,41 --> 00:59:24,55
and while you're certainly one global community just this certainly isn't because of some scientists because on part of

594
00:59:24,56 --> 00:59:25,07
it yeah

595
00:59:25,11 --> 00:59:34,72
but I think clearly the scientists who we have a Vatican meetings work on the environment I'm on health care etc That

596
00:59:34,73 --> 00:59:38,83
part of them cover community and what they care about are global problems

597
00:59:39,08 --> 00:59:47,03
and the key thing is to ensure that their voice spreads beyond academia to those who can really change the world

598
00:59:47,99 --> 00:59:53,46
thinking about coming back again to your own fields cosmology us all let's come to zoom out

599
00:59:54,06 --> 00:59:59,98
and looking at the universe and see your planet of the earth and we have this group of scientists.

600
01:00:00,04 --> 01:00:06,74
Trying to understand what the planet ourselves but also the universe.

601
01:00:06,74 --> 01:00:13,05
How do you see this from a cosmic perspective what are exactly doing here on this planet.

602
01:00:13,05 --> 01:00:20,18
Well because we don't know I think the more one understands about any phenomenon the more amazed one is by telling her

603
01:00:20,41 --> 01:00:22,42
I think.

604
01:00:22,42 --> 01:00:26,6
When I look at an insect now I'm more amazed by an insect

605
01:00:26,61 --> 01:00:33,34
when I realize all the chemical processes have to happen if it's just simply to move his leg so that the movement

606
01:00:33,35 --> 01:00:40,31
realizes how amazingly intricate the natural world is and in that sense the physical world of stars

607
01:00:40,32 --> 01:00:44,84
and galaxies is simpler than the biological world but of course it's got this sort of scale

608
01:00:45,1 --> 01:00:53,12
and I think it's been a privilege to be working in a subject where our perspective has changed

609
01:00:53,13 --> 01:00:59,06
and expanded in the few decades and of course.

610
01:00:59,06 --> 01:01:06,04
We've really had revolutions going back to the Copernican Revolution originally when we Earth was in the center

611
01:01:06,28 --> 01:01:11,79
and then we realized that our sun was just one star the galaxy

612
01:01:12,04 --> 01:01:16,18
and then I galaxy is just one of billions you can see there was a telescope

613
01:01:16,44 --> 01:01:22,33
and I think we are now perhaps going to be due for a fourth Copernican Revolution

614
01:01:22,65 --> 01:01:29,19
when we will learn that physical reality is much more extensive than the delayed we can see with even our biggest

615
01:01:29,2 --> 01:01:37,04
telescopes because we can see with that because telescopes to sort of horizon which is limited to the distance of like

616
01:01:37,05 --> 01:01:39,83
kind of travelled to us from since the Big Bang

617
01:01:40,45 --> 01:01:46,63
but there's nothing physically real about that horizon anymore there is about the rise of the round you if you are both

618
01:01:46,64 --> 01:01:52,97
in the ocean you don't think that the ocean ends beyond that and do good reasons to think that the.

619
01:01:52,97 --> 01:01:59,98
Universe extends probably at least a thousand times further we can see and probably must must be.

620
01:02:00,55 --> 01:02:04,58
And that's not all but this that's all.

621
01:02:04,58 --> 01:02:10,08
The aftermath of our big bang and then the other question is whether our Big Bang is the only one

622
01:02:10,39 --> 01:02:18,49
and there is a popular idea called the multiverse whether there is variance according to which there may be zillions of

623
01:02:18,53 --> 01:02:20,95
other big bands of which ours is just one

624
01:02:21,3 --> 01:02:28,62
and that they may all be governed by different physical laws the laws we don't know so it could be that there is an

625
01:02:28,63 --> 01:02:36,05
ecologically of Cosmos is on the scale far bigger than what we can observe so our perception of overall physical

626
01:02:36,06 --> 01:02:44,03
reality is rather like the perception of a planted in a spoonful of water of the entire earth you know we are very

627
01:02:44,04 --> 01:02:49,55
limited take this perspective which is all kind of making us kind of less special Yes On the other hand in the

628
01:02:49,56 --> 01:02:55,66
beginning of our complete sation we talked about the special nature of life on Earth we don't know how special it is by

629
01:02:55,67 --> 01:03:02,35
the fact that we have intelligent life in fact that we have life it is intelligent enough to look at the universe

630
01:03:02,39 --> 01:03:11,04
and have thought exactly like this so the title of this series we chose in the mind of the universe.

631
01:03:11,04 --> 01:03:19,92
Perhaps or set a mind to the universe which is this special role of us on planet Earth because.

632
01:03:19,92 --> 01:03:27,23
Certainly I think of this is one of the few places perhaps the only on we don't know where these kind of thoughts are

633
01:03:27,24 --> 01:03:37,58
just kind of shared are generated yet so again looking at this fast Hi Ricky.

634
01:03:37,58 --> 01:03:44,7
And our little little it's a little plant all in a drop of water and a huge ocean.

635
01:03:44,7 --> 01:03:49,75
What is that special role we have been observing all of that yes.

636
01:03:49,75 --> 01:03:57,24
Well it will be clear they are special in being able to deduce to grasp the glimmerings of these huge ideas

637
01:03:57,51 --> 01:04:03,47
and it may be the post human intelligence and. To grasp the more fully but clearly.

638
01:04:03,47 --> 01:04:12,15
Even though we don't know how common life is it's clear that we are living on a special planet this pale blue dot in

639
01:04:12,16 --> 01:04:17,41
the cosmos and it's also equally clear although less well appreciated

640
01:04:17,42 --> 01:04:21,98
when if you want a special time he says century is very special it's the first

641
01:04:21,99 --> 01:04:32,7
when one species namely the human species can determine the planet's fate and also this century when we can perhaps.

642
01:04:32,7 --> 01:04:38,73
Start a transition to a completely different form of intelligence based on the electronics and machines

643
01:04:39,05 --> 01:04:44,3
and perhaps spread beyond the Earth so this century is special so if you think of a space

644
01:04:44,31 --> 01:04:49,07
and time guard around you know this little dot in space and time is very special

645
01:04:49,55 --> 01:04:55,11
and if you spread it around we could be actually could be the mind of the universe Well our descendants could be here

646
01:04:55,12 --> 01:04:57,26
just. For example much.
