1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:10,78
But so what what makes it so are you with your eyes what you are doing with your T.V. The idea is to be open.

2
00:00:10,85 --> 00:00:19,19
I think open for. Looking for interesting solutions in nature and.

3
00:00:19,21 --> 00:00:25,47
The approach probably quite unique still for my group but I think in becoming more

4
00:00:25,47 --> 00:00:33,92
and more popular is if we have two directions of how we'll look at nature. One is.

5
00:00:33,93 --> 00:00:41,18
Let's say there is an interesting creature doing something in icing and we're trying to learn the.

6
00:00:41,87 --> 00:00:48,19
What is happening and maybe apply it. That's one approach and apply it.

7
00:00:48,31 --> 00:00:56,05
Maybe to different things but even more interesting is just emerging now is that instead of.

8
00:00:56,97 --> 00:01:05,54
Looking for one creature that tells us something. What if we take lessons from completely different organisms.

9
00:01:05,56 --> 00:01:11,39
They have nothing in common. They have different environments but one can teach something.

10
00:01:11,41 --> 00:01:15,79
But it's not enough for certain purposes. Together with yet another.

11
00:01:15,81 --> 00:01:17,83
Organism you can learn something else

12
00:01:18,61 --> 00:01:26,01
and combining lessons from completely different organisms that have all their things for. For their specific needs.

13
00:01:27,23 --> 00:01:35,39
But then to solve a certain problem so that's a really interesting approach is to really take small lessons from

14
00:01:35,39 --> 00:01:45,52
different from plants from little stars from because that I have research where combining lessons from this creature

15
00:01:46,22 --> 00:01:51,71
with this. So they have nothing in common but that one taught us something.

16
00:01:52,05 --> 00:01:59,31
This one taught us something combining them together to produce a new technology that would never appear if we wouldn't

17
00:01:59,31 --> 00:02:12,13
come by Miss. Lessons. So that the idea of combining different creatures to go. Some will was born from.

18
00:02:13,8 --> 00:02:23,89
So can you explain what. So you probably know what. Who are starfish.

19
00:02:24,36 --> 00:02:30,63
And I see your shit and so this is the closes role of relative for both.

20
00:02:31,14 --> 00:02:36,04
So it's also you see has five fold symmetry of the body just like a starfish.

21
00:02:36,31 --> 00:02:42,11
But it's called brittle stuff that its arms are called brittle as it's very fast.

22
00:02:42,21 --> 00:02:53,4
You see it's black and it's already dead. Of course but during the day it is black and during the night. It is white.

23
00:02:53,42 --> 00:03:03,36
And the way changes color is. By introducing inside the heat skeleton.

24
00:03:03,6 --> 00:03:10,47
Black people and that covers the lens just like some glasses that change color when there's too much light.

25
00:03:10,62 --> 00:03:18,87
This is what this organism does and makes light reception dynamic depending how much light outside.

26
00:03:19,27 --> 00:03:28,75
So that's the lesson from here. This one has structural color. So it's this blue.

27
00:03:28,77 --> 00:03:34,47
Is structural color structural color means that it's not chemical color.

28
00:03:34,62 --> 00:03:40,22
It's not coming from pigment it's coming from and arrangement of features.

29
00:03:40,42 --> 00:03:49,99
It's coming purely from distances between features in this structure so the penny how close they are it would be the

30
00:03:49,99 --> 00:03:54,43
blue green. So it has almost nothing to do with the material.

31
00:03:54,46 --> 00:04:02,85
I can get blue color in any material but just making it in the regular arranged. Now this color is not dynamic.

32
00:04:03,18 --> 00:04:14,26
It's not changing in any way. So we combine the idea of how liquid here changes color of this organism.

33
00:04:14,9 --> 00:04:18,86
And introduce this quid. As an active element.

34
00:04:19,21 --> 00:04:29,53
Into structures that would make very similar to that butterfly a result of that is that we put together a new

35
00:04:29,53 --> 00:04:38,04
technology where the color can change as in a function of infiltration of A with lid.

36
00:04:38,21 --> 00:04:48,03
But then we use this for very interesting applications. We're looking how that concept was liquid that.

37
00:04:48,73 --> 00:04:54,83
Suddenly changes color in different ways and I will probably show you a couple of those things in the lab.

38
00:04:54,85 --> 00:05:04,58
We use thought as sensor. We can use it to. For encryption.

39
00:05:05,6 --> 00:05:08,38
Because there are certain messages can be written there

40
00:05:08,38 --> 00:05:12,86
and you will never see them with actual have a butterfly with the two.

41
00:05:12,88 --> 00:05:17,69
The two is coming out only when you are exposed to a liquid.

42
00:05:18,21 --> 00:05:31,51
And that gives us a way to have missed messages longer that would appear only when you expose it to right with with.

43
00:05:31,53 --> 00:05:33,99
So the overall idea of dynamic materials.

44
00:05:34,59 --> 00:05:38,00
As I can but in this particular case by combining these strategies

45
00:05:38,00 --> 00:05:44,13
but we have many more examples of one organism tissues something and the other one.

46
00:05:44,27 --> 00:05:49,98
She teaches so that more and together it's interesting. And you lied to us.

47
00:05:50,04 --> 00:05:59,38
So we're making now and we're actually making. I actually have a lot of but most of them are.

48
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:07,27
Design School because I use them for teaching but we'll see some of them in my lab where it will.

49
00:06:07,29 --> 00:06:13,05
You will see it looks exactly like this beautiful blue color but it's actually material that will make.

50
00:06:13,63 --> 00:06:25,9
But compared to a very it's as simple as imagine a shot glass that has beautiful color

51
00:06:25,9 --> 00:06:33,96
and depending on what you drink it would give you different messages that you don't know really exist it's a simple way

52
00:06:33,96 --> 00:06:35,48
to make it beautiful.

53
00:06:35,97 --> 00:06:46,68
But in fact we can use it in particular we're working with the Department of Transportation to design it into a sensor

54
00:06:46,68 --> 00:06:53,64
for detection of oil. Quality. So in North Dakota.

55
00:06:54,06 --> 00:07:02,03
They're pulling out a lot of oil there is no five line and they're transporting it by rail.

56
00:07:02,73 --> 00:07:11,71
And within the last couple of years there were a lot of explosions because oil was not properly labeled by what type of

57
00:07:11,71 --> 00:07:19,98
oil that is. So to have a very simple detector that has beautiful color. And.

58
00:07:21,19 --> 00:07:25,87
Depending on the quality of well this well would either infiltrated or not

59
00:07:26,88 --> 00:07:31,53
and therefore the color will change in certain ways. Has a very simple.

60
00:07:31,64 --> 00:07:38,05
You don't need to use fancy equipment it's almost a pregnancy test or Ph paper.

61
00:07:38,66 --> 00:07:45,34
You've put it in oil and you know what quality it is in which. Container.

62
00:07:45,5 --> 00:07:52,58
You need to pack it so three or four major form from all your plans or.

63
00:07:53,24 --> 00:08:01,22
You learn from the characteristics from your work there you go deeper into what about is nobody. That's right.

64
00:08:01,29 --> 00:08:10,14
So I don't call it by a mimicry. Because I'm not mimicking nature. It is by inspired science.

65
00:08:10,47 --> 00:08:18,41
So I use it as an inspiration and things that I make a modern ceral in the used the same way nature use it.

66
00:08:18,47 --> 00:08:28,05
Often for completely different application it just so new design principles that nature has evolved become very

67
00:08:28,06 --> 00:08:36,04
interesting approaches that one can use for smart materials design. So it is not mimicking nature.

68
00:08:36,2 --> 00:08:46,14
It's taking lessons being is inspired by nature and think where we can use these. Beyond well beyond of what.

69
00:08:46,15 --> 00:08:54,88
Nature is doing and also how we can fit this moment mimic the entire complexity of natural system

70
00:08:54,88 --> 00:09:01,04
and probably I don't want to. So the bother flying this.

71
00:09:01,06 --> 00:09:05,94
See Us humans and I need to multiply the need to do all kinds of things.

72
00:09:06,15 --> 00:09:11,53
If I'm making a device let's say to detect quality of oil.

73
00:09:11,63 --> 00:09:20,51
I don't need all these features so being able to abstract from nature. So to take these principles and.

74
00:09:20,53 --> 00:09:28,33
Simplify them sometimes or reformulate them in such a way that it can be used somewhere else.

75
00:09:28,49 --> 00:09:46,7
This is what we actually do. Best where all organisms. I am in not agree with that I'm not sure. That evolution.

76
00:09:46,98 --> 00:09:59,67
Always Meigs the best choice in the sense that there is always local pressures local environmental conditions.

77
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:11,83
And often. Nature has the materials. Stuck with certain choices that is very expensive.

78
00:10:11,84 --> 00:10:21,35
To change and then within that range. I would say that. My Would you call solutions are often subtheme or not optimal.

79
00:10:22,97 --> 00:10:29,52
We have our ideas why in particular publish. And number of papers.

80
00:10:30,84 --> 00:10:39,33
So if we look at this paper which section describing how this organism changes color and but it's a skeleton.

81
00:10:40,03 --> 00:10:48,24
So nature often does something we do not do yet which is designing one material for multiple purposes.

82
00:10:49,25 --> 00:10:57,3
So often nature will design my not be best for each of the purposes it has to serve.

83
00:10:57,86 --> 00:11:05,93
That it does it very well for multiple things for example if I design lances and these alliances on top of a skeleton.

84
00:11:06,58 --> 00:11:11,69
Maybe I'll design lenses in a different way and better than these in a different material

85
00:11:11,69 --> 00:11:18,44
but the sane material is supposed to be a skeleton. So it's not just optical a perfect.

86
00:11:18,63 --> 00:11:24,69
It has to be structurally perfect. So neither of them are probably perfect.

87
00:11:25,1 --> 00:11:33,47
But to think about one material that can do both things well enough. Then evolution finds the best solution for that.

88
00:11:33,79 --> 00:11:41,85
And sometimes will can these optimisation you there are so many parameters you need to optimize for.

89
00:11:41,86 --> 00:11:49,39
Maybe there are some that we don't even know about and then what we can say flaws of evolution of it.

90
00:11:49,47 --> 00:11:52,21
It's not perfect it could be done better.

91
00:11:52,34 --> 00:12:02,3
Maybe not because the material is supposed to do many other things for example multiply. Dissolve at certain moment.

92
00:12:02,37 --> 00:12:11,2
And when our regular approaches of why not to make it out of Wes why not make it out of metal will not be political.

93
00:12:11,64 --> 00:12:19,08
And therefore not used in nature. So multi functionality is a need very interesting approach.

94
00:12:20,54 --> 00:12:33,54
It's also what you want doing. Yes major world. I don't know what I would say that I would just say that.

95
00:12:33,56 --> 00:12:41,3
Maybe there are creatures that already have these features but what we are trying to do is to combine.

96
00:12:41,32 --> 00:12:49,27
Unrelated lessons from different organisms together to solve an interesting societal problem.

97
00:12:49,47 --> 00:12:57,81
It's interesting technical problem to create a new material that can do something that our current materials can't do

98
00:12:59,28 --> 00:13:08,69
so. It is not the next nature but I would say its next generation of events materials materials that.

99
00:13:08,71 --> 00:13:20,43
Respond to environment so why can't we have our buildings. That. Either bring us. War shut.

100
00:13:20,6 --> 00:13:31,47
The They're wet ability depending on whether it's the rain outside of not my Can't we have our entire Windows that

101
00:13:31,47 --> 00:13:33,24
would.

102
00:13:34,00 --> 00:13:43,49
In a smart way which means in response to temperature outside to light outside change the performance even to have the

103
00:13:43,49 --> 00:13:53,03
lights through not there is so many things that one can do if we consider general lessons from nature that we haven't

104
00:13:53,03 --> 00:13:59,95
yet. Understood. Dude very well. Which is. Risk.

105
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:02,63
PONSON us which is adaptive nature

106
00:14:02,63 --> 00:14:14,63
and ability to reconfigure just if we would have materials of that kind that would be a really interesting one for

107
00:14:14,63 --> 00:14:24,63
forty Knology What's the most productive. Plant material. That's a tough question.

108
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:30,86
I have a very big group and in a way each of these projects is my baby.

109
00:14:31,12 --> 00:14:40,17
So you don't ask which baby you like most out of your kids. Each of them in some ways.

110
00:14:40,44 --> 00:14:52,56
Why is different parts of what is important to me if you would ask. What is the most interesting science.

111
00:14:53,09 --> 00:15:02,84
It's one part of that I don't often in this case ask question is it going to be useful is just to uncover interesting.

112
00:15:05,22 --> 00:15:09,51
Mechanisms ideas and what nature does in interesting ways

113
00:15:11,64 --> 00:15:15,74
and there are a couple of things where I'm very proud in this direction.

114
00:15:15,75 --> 00:15:22,95
For example to understand the structure of this punch. So. To.

115
00:15:23,32 --> 00:15:27,57
To understand that the organism was able to create the fiber optical network

116
00:15:27,57 --> 00:15:37,69
and the beautiful skeleton everything out of glass and you explain how this is structurally

117
00:15:37,7 --> 00:15:44,44
and from materials point of view its design and its architecture. That's so I'm proud of.

118
00:15:44,54 --> 00:15:50,74
I also like in this direction ability to grow pretty much any crystal.

119
00:15:50,9 --> 00:15:59,29
I want with me to look at some of them in the microscope later on. Just to grow flowers.

120
00:16:00,72 --> 00:16:07,88
That are just size of human hair are smaller than that but in any shape

121
00:16:08,8 --> 00:16:16,21
or form so that to understand the underlying science so well that we can do it so I'm very proud of that part.

122
00:16:16,55 --> 00:16:26,04
Now the other side though our study is that we do not just science purpose.

123
00:16:26,06 --> 00:16:32,14
But coming not from science and then thinking well one can use but to do it the other way around.

124
00:16:32,61 --> 00:16:40,03
Starting with the problem. And then think how one can solve it. So these are more technology or application.

125
00:16:40,32 --> 00:16:44,83
Oriented studies and there.

126
00:16:44,84 --> 00:16:55,45
And the ones that I'm most proud of probably are the two developments that have happened in my group when I was asked.

127
00:16:55,47 --> 00:17:07,65
Five six years and these are. Two technologies one is based on inspiration coming from Picher plant.

128
00:17:07,67 --> 00:17:18,19
Where we really developed a completely new family of materials that can be designed in a very simple way this moment we

129
00:17:18,19 --> 00:17:26,76
can make it in metal in Poland mined glass in any material but the material that would repel.

130
00:17:26,78 --> 00:17:34,56
What you want to repel it will repel ice it with repel barnacles and mussels to repel blood.

131
00:17:35,03 --> 00:17:44,68
To help Syria and to create the family off and they found willing to or else parrot proud of this work

132
00:17:44,68 --> 00:17:47,82
and I'm very proud of work.

133
00:17:47,84 --> 00:17:59,96
Where we can you use self assembled materials for the structural color actually as senses as a way to detect. And.

134
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:01,44
Three feel.

135
00:18:02,25 --> 00:18:11,85
How much rolls are exposed to environment so these are two that are related to applications so they are the overall

136
00:18:11,85 --> 00:18:17,21
idea for that came from. We want to solve the problem of let's say falling.

137
00:18:17,4 --> 00:18:22,45
What should we do which organism should we look at to help us do it.

138
00:18:22,58 --> 00:18:27,52
So not from the organisms to obligation but rather from application.

139
00:18:27,76 --> 00:18:42,65
To now to organisms and the chills system that can help. And when you look at it. We can create or.

140
00:18:42,67 --> 00:18:48,61
There is there is an endless future of possibilities. Your your science.

141
00:18:49,18 --> 00:18:59,75
For a whole new world opening your biology in this way. Thinking about Europe versus other materials.

142
00:19:00,76 --> 00:19:04,15
I agree the I hope that there would be more

143
00:19:04,15 --> 00:19:12,68
and more studies of this kind you just said a good example of that is our recent paper actually published this year in

144
00:19:12,68 --> 00:19:19,03
nature. Was on making the most efficient.

145
00:19:19,04 --> 00:19:24,43
Heat exchangers the most efficient water collection systems

146
00:19:25,65 --> 00:19:37,09
and the way we designed it was by combining lessons from three different natural systems where we were looking on how

147
00:19:37,1 --> 00:19:43,22
to optimize so we parameters. All of them are orthogonal to each other very different.

148
00:19:45,06 --> 00:19:52,52
And combining these three organisms gave us the best solution. Nothing in technology works as well as that.

149
00:19:52,59 --> 00:20:01,7
So the combined lessons from Desert be taught. From cactus and. From the chip plant.

150
00:20:01,72 --> 00:20:08,3
And we're able to put together something interesting but neither of them alone will teach us.

151
00:20:09,51 --> 00:20:12,72
Now how many of these capabilities. I'm sure it's endless.

152
00:20:13,01 --> 00:20:18,95
There are so many organisms and there are so many things about organisms that nobody has started yet

153
00:20:19,92 --> 00:20:28,26
and anglers convene a nation of something that nature evolved here because it was important for this organism

154
00:20:28,26 --> 00:20:33,41
and somewhere else because it was important for another organism and together.

155
00:20:33,62 --> 00:20:45,58
It gives I'm usually unexpected solution that nobody can easily come up with that concept so it's not general obvious.

156
00:20:47,11 --> 00:20:53,84
We're not trying to go and. And to try to do the obvious science it's it's.

157
00:20:54,48 --> 00:21:04,93
I'm leavin untraditional unorthodox combinations that we're trying to do where you start from.

158
00:21:05,96 --> 00:21:17,85
Where review your passion for. Looking at major words. I can't even remember I think it was always that.

159
00:21:19,86 --> 00:21:27,97
I guess in some ways there was a little bit of a unpleasant beginning of all that.

160
00:21:30,2 --> 00:21:43,4
When I was a child when I was two years old when I first time when I went to kindergarten and. My.

161
00:21:45,17 --> 00:21:58,59
Nurse in the kindergarten by mistake gave me triple those of ten of that scene. Four and three Paula.

162
00:22:00,00 --> 00:22:10,84
That scene at that time Vixen was. The wife and I actually was paralyzed for. A number of years.

163
00:22:10,86 --> 00:22:20,46
So when I was paralyzed I was in the sanatorium. Out on the Black Sea. I was exposed to.

164
00:22:20,48 --> 00:22:25,77
Two shells two waves two to Black Sea at that time there at.

165
00:22:26,04 --> 00:22:35,00
Unpleasant times but at the same time it was the time when there are kids up running around and playing

166
00:22:35,01 --> 00:22:49,1
and I was in a chair. And. That was the beginning of looking observing nature and loving it. Really. Then in school.

167
00:22:49,11 --> 00:22:55,93
I guess. So I was one of all the mathematical volunteers.

168
00:22:56,18 --> 00:23:07,11
So science was always something I wanted to do it was never a question. It was a question of which science. But.

169
00:23:08,47 --> 00:23:13,86
I guess that. I. And my parents were very influential for me.

170
00:23:14,73 --> 00:23:24,02
We constantly had discussions and some fights between them whether I would follow my dad steps on my mom steps

171
00:23:24,02 --> 00:23:34,39
and I decided to combine both my my mom was a medical doctor. And civically interested in infectious diseases.

172
00:23:34,41 --> 00:23:37,53
And I do now. A lot of work in.

173
00:23:37,55 --> 00:23:47,16
Making materials for medical devices that prevent infections that prevent the cheeriest to form.

174
00:23:48,7 --> 00:23:51,81
And my dad is a structural engineer.

175
00:23:51,83 --> 00:23:59,08
Who's wanted me to be an engineer and this combination actually is really interesting.

176
00:24:01,26 --> 00:24:08,43
I guess that they mentioned I can track it back to the time

177
00:24:08,43 --> 00:24:30,09
when I was three four years old this year where was your if you were. You know and that's right. And I'm sorry. What.

178
00:24:30,11 --> 00:24:34,64
Always interested me. And it's something that probably.

179
00:24:34,66 --> 00:24:43,03
I keep doing it till now is pattern from ation it's not only seashells let's say.

180
00:24:43,05 --> 00:24:50,03
But we know how waves leave interesting signs on ascent.

181
00:24:50,24 --> 00:25:02,47
So these bromide and the patterns left behind by by the waves on. On ascent was my obsession for a very long time.

182
00:25:02,69 --> 00:25:10,00
So since I was mostly interested in mathematics at them as a student did in school.

183
00:25:10,99 --> 00:25:21,25
I actually thought that I would be applied mathematics and but them. I was convinced that by doing physical chemistry.

184
00:25:21,49 --> 00:25:28,92
I could still do a lot of mathematics but I can also do physics chemistry and biology.

185
00:25:28,93 --> 00:25:39,54
And it was quite a come convincing argument to to. To get the job in Moscow University the chemistry department.

186
00:25:39,56 --> 00:25:42,67
So it's better information.

187
00:25:43,14 --> 00:25:53,36
How different features form and many things in my research in particular better than zero in these phony Christophe's

188
00:25:53,36 --> 00:26:05,14
or patterns. On this bondage. You see probably butt. The patterns on these sponsors are extremely close so.

189
00:26:05,16 --> 00:26:15,73
If you look at the heart this is a not living anymore but it's a natural spine which it's fully This is skeleton of it.

190
00:26:15,77 --> 00:26:22,63
It's fully made of glass just like we make our buildings and our windows

191
00:26:23,83 --> 00:26:30,26
but I hope you see that in addition to just beautiful glass architecture.

192
00:26:30,55 --> 00:26:36,24
Here is there a regular It has something like a chessboard structure.

193
00:26:36,69 --> 00:26:44,15
So there's one window open another one is closed and that's again pattern.

194
00:26:44,39 --> 00:26:45,24
I was interested

195
00:26:45,24 --> 00:26:57,96
when I started to look at that how this symmetry that can arise from a living organism how can it foam a skeleton with

196
00:26:57,96 --> 00:27:07,42
such an incredible regularity. If you look here. There are also diagonal elements running through this point.

197
00:27:08,46 --> 00:27:18,56
And they're running. Exactly. Every force square every four square. Every second square. It has a dark square.

198
00:27:18,64 --> 00:27:33,46
So there's an incredible regularity so the origin of these features the origin of this order is all within the.

199
00:27:33,48 --> 00:27:41,54
Our studies of how patterns. How interesting assembly works. What the human.

200
00:27:43,35 --> 00:27:51,49
What do you do with the information you got from the spot which you why with what we do here you. So this is.

201
00:27:51,51 --> 00:28:01,74
There is a couple of things that we are trying to do hopefully is to what we do is we simplify this. Spawn's design.

202
00:28:01,76 --> 00:28:03,45
So these are three D. Printed.

203
00:28:04,02 --> 00:28:12,84
And this one has all the structural elements this one chair has this one has all that Wes this one.

204
00:28:12,85 --> 00:28:17,84
So we make different types of this.

205
00:28:17,85 --> 00:28:25,67
Structure to understand why nature ended up with this specific architecture to make the most.

206
00:28:27,3 --> 00:28:35,88
Mechanical with strong material. So the. The lessons that we learn from the art is how to make. Most.

207
00:28:36,54 --> 00:28:48,94
Mechanical or strong glass that one can range from very small scale to their lifestyle. So within this point in fact I.

208
00:28:48,96 --> 00:29:04,22
Gave couple of lectures. Describing. But if you look at this from every level. I can probably teach an entire class of.

209
00:29:04,24 --> 00:29:17,74
Civil engineering and everything we use in the design. Laminated materials. Or fiber inforced materials or.

210
00:29:18,71 --> 00:29:27,6
Cemented structures. Everything every element that we use now is actual ready used by the spine.

211
00:29:28,06 --> 00:29:35,98
So it's a lot of interesting things where there is additional features in particular hierarchy how nature makes it from

212
00:29:35,98 --> 00:29:45,11
the nano scale up to this macroscopic scale. To avoid cards that this point has in the sea.

213
00:29:45,13 --> 00:29:53,77
So there is a lot of interesting lessons but again there is a lesson in multi functionality. This is a skeleton.

214
00:29:55,01 --> 00:30:04,84
But it's also. In our opinion designed. To control and optimize three functions at least.

215
00:30:05,2 --> 00:30:16,19
Which is it has to be strong because it's skeleton. But it also has five. But these are optical fibers and that couple.

216
00:30:16,67 --> 00:30:20,74
Into this structure most of them. I already removed for my research.

217
00:30:21,39 --> 00:30:25,83
So the structure has to act as a beacon in the scene.

218
00:30:25,84 --> 00:30:30,39
So how one can use go as to make optical fibers

219
00:30:30,39 --> 00:30:40,16
and also skeletons out of glass in the actual conditions not the two thousand degrees C. As we deal with glass.

220
00:30:40,83 --> 00:30:50,27
But in addition to that spine is a primitive organism sponges bre. And. He lived by.

221
00:30:51,43 --> 00:31:01,85
Pumping seawater through these openings all these openings in its structure is for pumping seawater.

222
00:31:01,87 --> 00:31:09,14
Then organic particles that are coming through this body. Are up taken.

223
00:31:09,51 --> 00:31:16,15
And the psych toast by this primitive it's not a woman it's a multicellular organism.

224
00:31:16,16 --> 00:31:20,76
But it doesn't have organs it has nothing is really primitive. How ever.

225
00:31:21,35 --> 00:31:31,5
It's able on combining optical properties mechanical properties and what we believe the design with this nice.

226
00:31:31,52 --> 00:31:41,31
Structure of opening one poor closing another one has having served function to optimize fluidics so that it doesn't

227
00:31:41,31 --> 00:31:44,76
need to use too much energy to pump.

228
00:31:47,2 --> 00:31:54,88
Water through the structure so that some windows are open more than others and in addition to that.

229
00:31:55,28 --> 00:32:05,71
I don't know how much you could see but there are two white. Things inside. The trouble maybe can you get it out.

230
00:32:06,02 --> 00:32:12,53
Maybe it's very sticky so very difficult to get it out. Maybe now you could see them better.

231
00:32:12,65 --> 00:32:14,57
This is part of the cool

232
00:32:14,57 --> 00:32:28,24
or off of a shrimp that lives inside the spines symbiotic away with spines so we learn a lot about natural symbiotic

233
00:32:28,24 --> 00:32:41,66
life. Of how to make mechanical strong materials and optical fibers and it's all designed for these. Shrimp.

234
00:32:42,24 --> 00:32:51,88
To be protected from environments so nobody can catch them and eat them. But for shrimp to be able to eat. Needs food.

235
00:32:52,1 --> 00:32:59,95
So how would the shrimp get the food. The optical fibers provide enough elimination.

236
00:32:59,97 --> 00:33:06,29
So that everything is attracted to light. Outcome of that there is always feast.

237
00:33:06,99 --> 00:33:12,93
And so they have more than enough food. And the products of their life cycles are all there.

238
00:33:13,41 --> 00:33:25,14
Excrements are used by sponge for it's own. Feeding So it's really interesting ideas. However.

239
00:33:25,94 --> 00:33:35,78
What if and we're thinking about it. We don't know whether it would be. After all the outcome of the app but what if.

240
00:33:35,79 --> 00:33:45,21
We'll look at that and we think about. A future building. So this building. This three D. Printed version.

241
00:33:45,23 --> 00:33:53,75
Has every structural element that this point has this point is also building because shrimp lives inside.

242
00:33:53,77 --> 00:33:59,52
But what if we would actually use the idea of energy.

243
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:07,85
Saving ideas the sponge has already evolved which is in this case to pump water.

244
00:34:07,87 --> 00:34:08,68
Through the system

245
00:34:09,4 --> 00:34:19,18
but in this case it could be a building where size of the openings of some of the windows would be open for airflow for

246
00:34:19,19 --> 00:34:25,69
wind so that you could have most efficient energy balance of the building

247
00:34:25,69 --> 00:34:34,98
but at the same time mechanical in it would have all these diagonal elements you can see again one mopin one closed so

248
00:34:34,98 --> 00:34:37,5
that mechanical it's very strong

249
00:34:37,5 --> 00:34:46,77
but it's actually on top of that is statically very pleasing what if it was building this is lesson from spawn.

250
00:34:46,92 --> 00:34:55,2
But what if this building would also have lessons that we can take from that from butterflies

251
00:34:55,94 --> 00:35:06,85
and this building will change color. Due to the weak with coming through certain places and during. Rain.

252
00:35:07,1 --> 00:35:18,46
It would reveal certain messages and you would see a dynamic color change as natural conditions. Change or the windows.

253
00:35:18,47 --> 00:35:22,86
Yet another project that will like it would have this ability to control.

254
00:35:23,55 --> 00:35:39,28
The light intensity so we're really thinking about and it's not anywhere close here but we're thinking about building.

255
00:35:40,28 --> 00:35:46,35
That's why I probably coughing us so far away that is it difficult to imagine that we're anywhere close.

256
00:35:46,67 --> 00:35:56,34
But what if our future would be materials that combine smarts solutions from completely different organisms.

257
00:35:57,03 --> 00:35:59,83
And that gives us an environment.

258
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:13,54
Materials an entire architecture that is capable of the most efficient way control airflow to control resistance from

259
00:36:13,54 --> 00:36:25,35
ice formation to control optical properties reconfigure change depending on which side.

260
00:36:25,84 --> 00:36:38,74
It is depending on what part of the world this building is going to be built in so that's if I where to dream big.

261
00:36:39,69 --> 00:36:41,39
This is what I hope we can.

262
00:36:42,91 --> 00:36:52,63
Make this building out of us interesting puzzles and interesting ideas that nature has created in nature has evolved

263
00:36:53,56 --> 00:37:05,16
and probably waiting for us to uncover when we discover this spot spines five. So it's so there is.

264
00:37:07,24 --> 00:37:14,91
I was very interested in Spawn Jews. A long time ago when I was a student in the Weizmann Institute.

265
00:37:17,5 --> 00:37:20,86
So how do so should should I know where do you want me to hold it.

266
00:37:20,91 --> 00:37:31,4
You know just so then you can go because you want to go and buy from now. OK for the last five or noticeable.

267
00:37:31,42 --> 00:37:35,14
So this pint. When it's alive.

268
00:37:35,43 --> 00:37:44,61
It's coated with a thin layer of brownish cells but all these windows are actually open for pumping water through it.

269
00:37:44,77 --> 00:37:54,57
But it's attached to ocean floor right here. What is called Whole fast. Apparatus. But it has multiple function.

270
00:37:54,88 --> 00:38:03,78
So not only if holds it inside the floor. But at the. And of each of these fibers. So these are all tickle fibers.

271
00:38:04,13 --> 00:38:14,75
There's a crown of optical fibers surrounding this point which is this crown. Is has the Waveland saw the light.

272
00:38:15,14 --> 00:38:22,69
So she waited with the. Bonus and tear that lives in the ocean floor.

273
00:38:23,34 --> 00:38:31,66
And the light produced by this book Tear this couple into these fibers and it's shines.

274
00:38:31,68 --> 00:38:38,78
Really similar to these fiber optical lamps like a compass like.

275
00:38:40,19 --> 00:38:44,05
Light coming from from bacterias coupled to these lenses

276
00:38:44,05 --> 00:38:51,62
and the end of each of the of this Piven is a lens for efficient coupling of light

277
00:38:52,31 --> 00:39:00,01
and it shines very similar to these optical fibers that we all know

278
00:39:00,87 --> 00:39:07,32
and we think that the we invented fiber optics just sixty years ago or so

279
00:39:07,32 --> 00:39:12,41
but in fact this is one of the all the state organisms that exist

280
00:39:12,41 --> 00:39:22,86
and they knew how to make possible optical things like them so it's really the same principle is the structure of these

281
00:39:22,86 --> 00:39:33,5
fibers would have a higher index score and lower index cladding and the signal goes through the center of the fiber

282
00:39:33,5 --> 00:39:38,06
and shines at the end it actually shines in many places because it.

283
00:39:38,49 --> 00:39:47,44
Surely shines almost like a Christmas tree because it has a major point where light coming off is on the tip that some

284
00:39:47,44 --> 00:39:51,8
of these fibers. Have branches and these also are.

285
00:39:52,23 --> 00:39:59,89
Highlighted due to the out coupling of light in these what they shouldn't. Doesn't. It's deep in in the oath.

286
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:09,56
And there is no sunlight there so the only light that is coming are from from the ocean floor now may be you could see.

287
00:40:09,62 --> 00:40:23,44
I hope you could see it one second. There are two here is inside these pines these two why things. If you see them.

288
00:40:23,51 --> 00:40:34,48
If you can focus on though you can try to wiggle them around. These are close of the shrimp that lives inside.

289
00:40:35,96 --> 00:40:41,96
So one may say that compared to shrimp. That is freely swimming.

290
00:40:42,13 --> 00:40:49,56
It is a disadvantage because they cannot swim and find food. But it's actually an advantage.

291
00:40:49,78 --> 00:40:55,95
First and then teaches pretty much nothing can crunch the six remaining strong material.

292
00:40:56,1 --> 00:41:08,08
So the mechanical protect that there's no anyone is really for this room. They may want to but they cannot. Crack.

293
00:41:08,52 --> 00:41:16,98
Crashed the glass now food comes from the fact that this is as a fiber optic

294
00:41:16,98 --> 00:41:23,2
and it's enough light in this area in the ocean.

295
00:41:23,88 --> 00:41:27,62
So that anything living is always attracted to light

296
00:41:28,62 --> 00:41:37,14
and the density of food that these shrimp can eat is pretty high and the.

297
00:41:37,15 --> 00:41:50,52
In this way it is nice combination of symbiotic life between. Bonus and bacteria. Sponge. And shrimp.

298
00:41:50,73 --> 00:41:59,54
That leaves inside and. None of them alone would be able to survive. Especially.

299
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:07,73
In the conditions where there's almost no white and the food is really depleted.

300
00:42:08,07 --> 00:42:14,45
As you go deeper into bone the ocean The together. It produces a very interesting system.

301
00:42:14,47 --> 00:42:23,15
So that's how we think about new materials new designs of combining things together

302
00:42:23,15 --> 00:42:33,67
and thinking how different organisms can teach us something that current materials or current devices Daunte use yet.

303
00:42:33,99 --> 00:42:45,1
Just because it's up to see how. That you know I wouldn't recommend.

304
00:42:46,16 --> 00:42:53,61
Flashing this to your clothes because it would immediately attach sin in mazing it's another feature that has a

305
00:42:53,61 --> 00:43:08,54
credible. Ability to better than Belk or to attach anything. So could you. You have three laps. Yes.

306
00:43:09,17 --> 00:43:24,1
I have one lab in three different locations or. When you describe this we live or. So the difference really.

307
00:43:24,48 --> 00:43:31,32
I would still probably prefer everything to be in one location so that people talk to each other even want although we

308
00:43:31,32 --> 00:43:44,97
always have a lot of activities together. In some ways they're divided by topics maybe that many topics that.

309
00:43:46,25 --> 00:43:56,09
Generally speaking I would say in my one lap the lab that is here. In the engineering building.

310
00:43:57,16 --> 00:43:59,81
There's a lot of projects that are related to.

311
00:44:01,4 --> 00:44:09,52
Dynamic materials to self assembly to making colorful materials responsive materials

312
00:44:10,43 --> 00:44:22,75
and it has a lot of work with more than one big man's. Optical devices and so on. It's one lamp.

313
00:44:24,23 --> 00:44:26,27
Thinking about the ways one can.

314
00:44:26,96 --> 00:44:37,91
For example some other paper that was sewn on on the car over Joan of how to make materials assemble. In. Absolutely.

315
00:44:37,99 --> 00:44:48,89
Interesting patterns so that is in one wound. And it's very generally described. I would say as self assembly and.

316
00:44:49,4 --> 00:45:02,76
Dynamic response of materials a lot of synthesis is done and this lamp. My other lab is doing a lot of research.

317
00:45:03,65 --> 00:45:05,46
And they've found in materials

318
00:45:05,46 --> 00:45:14,66
but specifically non-biological materials so using ph a plant as a inspiration to make materials that repel ice

319
00:45:14,66 --> 00:45:22,5
materials that can be used in heat exchangers. Program.

320
00:45:22,66 --> 00:45:29,34
It's found in generally but it's a lot of studies of what is it. Why they perform like that.

321
00:45:29,56 --> 00:45:38,72
What would be the from the mental science and physical and chemical principles to understand.

322
00:45:38,74 --> 00:45:48,24
What you want you to talk to mice than where dust before has come from. And that's really fluidics and.

323
00:45:50,78 --> 00:45:59,86
Materials characterization. Related to. Wetting phenomena. These surface.

324
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:05,05
Will these structures that were made be whacked by different media.

325
00:46:05,68 --> 00:46:13,27
And the third law is somewhat related to second but it's more on.

326
00:46:13,66 --> 00:46:22,17
Biological falling so and not necessarily falling it would be a wrong thing to say falling. I would say.

327
00:46:22,18 --> 00:46:34,85
By now interfaces. So in some cases you want to repel things for example want to rebuild. You want to rebel.

328
00:46:36,57 --> 00:46:40,1
Muscles environment goals from ships in the ocean.

329
00:46:40,4 --> 00:46:47,12
But in other cases it could be to create materials on which we can harvest algae.

330
00:46:47,33 --> 00:46:53,11
For energy production but it's again there's a lot of questions one can ask.

331
00:46:53,71 --> 00:46:57,05
One you need to harvest them so they feel comfortable

332
00:46:57,06 --> 00:47:04,71
but then you need to have ways to release them from the structures

333
00:47:04,71 --> 00:47:07,74
and services that are used for their production so the third.

334
00:47:08,41 --> 00:47:20,19
Is mostly related to growing cultures crowing algae in their words or solutions words or conditions and.

335
00:47:20,21 --> 00:47:23,86
I do identifying the structure.

336
00:47:23,88 --> 00:47:31,89
How they interact with the materials that will make them to really come up with recipes.

337
00:47:33,4 --> 00:47:42,01
For different applications so one can say we have a general approach that we learn from the teacher plant.

338
00:47:42,97 --> 00:47:49,71
It's but it's. It's called platform technology. So it's really.

339
00:47:49,72 --> 00:47:57,41
There are parts of that that can be combined in different ways depending whether you want to do it on glass on a metal

340
00:47:58,57 --> 00:48:03,26
and depending whether you. Want to rip out more in things we want to repel ice.

341
00:48:03,64 --> 00:48:12,6
So one can use it as a system design with different components. Depending what you want to do and we do study a lot.

342
00:48:13,39 --> 00:48:22,07
How different combinations of materials together. Give the best outcome for a specific target.

343
00:48:23,41 --> 00:48:25,51
It's strange that you

344
00:48:25,52 --> 00:48:40,86
or all of our scientists are there so that's what I was all MY GOD YOU'RE VERY sensitive as Michael as you know that

345
00:48:40,86 --> 00:48:48,76
injuries and a cough. But it's a surreal environment. There are cars but it's so strange when you look for help.

346
00:48:48,76 --> 00:49:00,24
Metal that we met on corrosion or you something's whistling you know I'm sensitive.

347
00:49:00,25 --> 00:49:05,69
And I met on corrosion between acceptance four times over for a little while.

348
00:49:06,84 --> 00:49:16,65
But you found this is this material that you can control and that would change what's so strange that it.

349
00:49:16,67 --> 00:49:25,66
Now we're five years and not earlier. That's true but I think that will make a lot of interesting.

350
00:49:25,79 --> 00:49:31,16
We as a science in general are not talking about my web only if we open our eyes

351
00:49:31,97 --> 00:49:40,63
and think in the very nontraditional terms about what we can learn from nature we can suddenly realize there have been

352
00:49:40,63 --> 00:49:44,44
many interesting solutions that we have no idea.

353
00:49:44,5 --> 00:49:51,72
Exist and many of them in fact extremely A simple in particular the pitcher plant that is very simple

354
00:49:53,21 --> 00:50:02,58
but it is counter-intuitive So if we talk about it then. When I'm trying to explain.

355
00:50:03,31 --> 00:50:14,81
The system when I say is counter-intuitive because everything in it is against the rules that are commonly used in.

356
00:50:15,56 --> 00:50:16,66
In the current acknowledges

357
00:50:16,66 --> 00:50:31,23
and well established rules for example if we think about how to make a material that has as little friction as possible.

358
00:50:32,18 --> 00:50:40,68
So the way we do it now would polish everything Polish so that the surface has as minimal number of defects because

359
00:50:40,68 --> 00:50:46,13
every defect produces friction. So if we talk about pipes.

360
00:50:46,6 --> 00:50:54,1
Everything is polished because otherwise it would create turbulence. When we transport oil or water.

361
00:50:55,74 --> 00:51:04,7
If it anywhere else. It's if we think about the materials that need to get all the laws friction possible.

362
00:51:04,88 --> 00:51:09,68
You need to get rid of roughness now. What.

363
00:51:09,7 --> 00:51:19,1
Peter plant is doing is that it actually creates at the extreme really rough surface it is structured surface which.

364
00:51:19,74 --> 00:51:31,68
By all the laws of physics is supposed to be extremely. That if you want to produce friction free material.

365
00:51:31,7 --> 00:51:38,89
However it is high friction when it's dry. So that AMS or.

366
00:51:39,19 --> 00:51:48,96
Insects are capable of moving around on the surface of this beach or planned on a dry day being happy

367
00:51:48,96 --> 00:51:52,81
and having no idea what may happen when there is rain.

368
00:51:53,26 --> 00:51:59,84
But what happens when there is rain is that this structured surface picks up.

369
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,29
Water because it's hydrophilic it likes water. And by picking up water.

370
00:52:06,44 --> 00:52:18,68
It creates a layer over layer of a liquid that is trapped inside the structure it's on the outcome of that that you

371
00:52:18,68 --> 00:52:24,66
have a structured material. Braff material. But it.

372
00:52:24,67 --> 00:52:32,74
Roughness has an secondary role its role is to hold water and Ellie and.

373
00:52:32,76 --> 00:52:37,52
What insects would experience is not there are surface.

374
00:52:37,98 --> 00:52:47,73
You use rough surface to create ultra smooth surface because your final outcome is the surface of water

375
00:52:47,74 --> 00:52:55,48
and liquids have no defects. So that's what I'm saying is counter-intuitive because we use roughness.

376
00:52:56,07 --> 00:53:03,59
To get rid of roughness in a way. And also we use liquid as a material.

377
00:53:03,61 --> 00:53:12,4
That is not that many places where liquid can be considered as a material. It could be used. Let's say in three D.

378
00:53:12,4 --> 00:53:25,64
Printing or anywhere else. To make something out of it but the final outcome is a solid. So until the solids.

379
00:53:25,65 --> 00:53:34,77
In this case. Liquid is part of it together with the saw it it makes a new concept.

380
00:53:35,28 --> 00:53:39,1
Liquid alone doesn't do it solid alone doesn't do it.

381
00:53:40,14 --> 00:53:44,74
But combining these together gives an interesting outcome

382
00:53:44,74 --> 00:53:50,31
and that's why I'm saying is counter-intuitive because we use roughness to get rid of roughness

383
00:53:50,31 --> 00:53:59,51
and we use liquids stored in a way inside structures surfaces that alter nicely inside.

384
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:07,03
To take advantage of liquids that otherwise cannot be shaped cannot favor the runaway.

385
00:54:07,85 --> 00:54:15,92
But now they're inside your material and they lend the material with its properties.

386
00:54:16,76 --> 00:54:26,12
So this is brittle star used to have five arms. I just removed one arm for analysis. So it changes color.

387
00:54:26,17 --> 00:54:33,27
Not all brittle stars do that but this species does. And during the day it's black and the reason is black.

388
00:54:33,3 --> 00:54:39,62
During the day is that it has lenses on his surface that.

389
00:54:41,09 --> 00:54:45,58
Regulate the white intensity depending how much lived outside

390
00:54:46,61 --> 00:54:53,89
and the Receptus on to under the lens can work only in certain range. So when it's too bright.

391
00:54:55,73 --> 00:55:03,5
We cover the lens with a black Big meant and therefore the entire organism changes color to black and at might

392
00:55:03,5 --> 00:55:07,8
when actually they're active species they're doing everything at night

393
00:55:07,8 --> 00:55:18,46
when that's not enough light they withdraw the Pigman back into the into the structure opening the lenses to more

394
00:55:18,46 --> 00:55:19,98
efficient collection of light.

395
00:55:20,03 --> 00:55:29,08
So the color change here is due to the dynamic nature of bringing a liquid in in this case big meant

396
00:55:29,08 --> 00:55:30,82
and then was drawing it back.

397
00:55:31,56 --> 00:55:39,95
So the idea of bringing liquids in into materials is now very common theme in many of my projects

398
00:55:39,95 --> 00:55:49,8
and some of them are completely unrelated but it's thinking about liquids in and own. Materials.

399
00:55:49,82 --> 00:55:59,82
One question of why they were black about why I should think so. It's.

400
00:56:00,00 --> 00:56:05,82
Not mimicry it's not mimicking environment and in fact this is what.

401
00:56:05,84 --> 00:56:13,72
At the beginning biological literature was using this as and another example of mimicking the environment

402
00:56:13,72 --> 00:56:16,21
and changing the color accordingly.

403
00:56:16,23 --> 00:56:18,21
It's actually opposite of what you would expect

404
00:56:19,26 --> 00:56:25,19
and that was a big mistake that was what attracted me to this topic is best.

405
00:56:25,49 --> 00:56:30,51
It's not hiding there goes it's just being even better seen during the day

406
00:56:30,51 --> 00:56:40,87
and even more so during the night the function here is to optimize light collection and fair for during the night.

407
00:56:40,96 --> 00:56:47,95
You want to get rid of Bateman and during the day you want to screen your lenses from excessive light.

408
00:56:48,24 --> 00:56:57,66
So it's not mimicking the color of environment it's optimizing its technology which is in this case than any glances.

409
00:56:58,24 --> 00:57:03,08
That's exactly what your memory biologist is not. That's correct.

410
00:57:03,31 --> 00:57:13,33
So biology is always look for common very comfortable terminology of the way I used to suddenly to tell the story

411
00:57:13,33 --> 00:57:19,81
but no the entire color change has a completely different function and it's to optimize

412
00:57:19,81 --> 00:57:25,04
and improve the performance of optical elements and it's optics.

413
00:57:25,23 --> 00:57:32,64
It's not only skeleton overall thinking that skeleton can also be an optical.

414
00:57:33,11 --> 00:57:41,47
Element is really really interesting idea. Think about. Buildings that are of course mechanic or strong.

415
00:57:41,81 --> 00:57:51,57
But also have builtin optical structures so the same construction is actually it's own up to Cologne

416
00:57:51,57 --> 00:57:59,69
and that collects live or to reflect slides. So it's pretty interesting so different for you.

417
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:08,61
Biology says that you know the group more than organisms. This is the cure for six other functions.

418
00:58:10,03 --> 00:58:18,44
I'd say I look more for. If I may say high tech properties.

419
00:58:19,8 --> 00:58:28,69
If it's I'm less interested or those extremely important to understand what up the specific cellular.

420
00:58:28,71 --> 00:58:36,81
Mechanisms that are involved in making this specific biological structures or what is the.

421
00:58:36,83 --> 00:58:44,26
Biological cellular biology or or proteins or. Paula secularize that are involved in these functions.

422
00:58:44,6 --> 00:58:56,61
I'm more interested in technology and more interest rate interested in devices that became an outcome of the evolution.

423
00:58:56,63 --> 00:59:01,85
That the form. Hi tech functions so I'm interested in mechanics.

424
00:59:02,03 --> 00:59:07,07
I'm interested in optics and I'm interested but optics beyond eyes.

425
00:59:07,35 --> 00:59:13,91
We know all about our eyes because we need to know about it but other interesting optical solutions

426
00:59:14,61 --> 00:59:20,7
and I'm looking for my next structures in nature how nature makes magnetic materials that are different from us.

427
00:59:20,94 --> 00:59:28,54
So it's really I would say technical characteristics of biological materials right.

428
00:59:28,99 --> 00:59:35,33
When you're looking your future how where are we are we humans with our technology will break.

429
00:59:36,84 --> 00:59:42,64
Technological possibility where are we going to. That's the question.

430
00:59:43,02 --> 00:59:49,54
I'm not sure I can say where we're going I hope I can tell you what I feel would be very important

431
00:59:50,46 --> 00:59:59,57
and what I think he'll really interesting and very rich area would be too great.

432
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:12,08
Knowledge is materials that have the ability to self assemble self assemble that uses environment as a trigger.

433
01:00:12,73 --> 01:00:21,29
For behavioral changes not to overuse and every time. Everything is run by hinges might change him.

434
01:00:21,3 --> 01:00:26,2
Switching on and off they may have and this is what organisms do

435
01:00:26,2 --> 01:00:36,69
and I hope the future might be to create a range of interesting materials that know how to switch behavior from.

436
01:00:37,67 --> 01:00:49,66
Letting some in on not from being. From accepting water to repel in water because in some cases when it's too dry.

437
01:00:50,33 --> 01:00:56,41
You really want the water to come in you want the building to breeze but when it's extremely wet

438
01:00:57,23 --> 01:00:58,5
and there's a rain every day.

439
01:00:59,72 --> 01:01:07,83
You actually want to repel it so how can one create the same material that will change its own function in response to

440
01:01:07,83 --> 01:01:15,86
what happens outside. I think this is the future. At least it's my take on the future of our program is called the my.

441
01:01:16,76 --> 01:01:24,34
And your or there are barriers accessibility to knowledge are gone down by the Internet.

442
01:01:24,38 --> 01:01:38,04
Were you born in the world of never heard from again. Or do you think about the grease somehow created corners here.

443
01:01:38,99 --> 01:01:44,05
It's a difficult question and I watch my grandson.

444
01:01:44,16 --> 01:01:54,24
He is almost six years old with even when he was two he was already trying to look on the cell phone

445
01:01:54,24 --> 01:02:01,1
and he knew how to move things around then that you and he at certain moment he came. To our T.V.

446
01:02:01,1 --> 01:02:07,89
and Was trying to open window on the T.V. and He was he was so surprised that it's not doing it.

447
01:02:07,94 --> 01:02:13,04
So there are problems maybe with the fact that you're on the

448
01:02:13,04 --> 01:02:20,6
when we need to learn anything you can have access to any information. Any moment. You want it.

449
01:02:21,85 --> 01:02:32,36
How ever at the same time I still hope that there is something that these days is easier to do than before

450
01:02:32,36 --> 01:02:43,84
and I hope that we will benefit from that and this is multidisciplinary team. In the way.

451
01:02:44,81 --> 01:02:52,03
So I'm a physical chemist my training northern engineer. I'm not a biologist. I'm not a medical doctor.

452
01:02:52,31 --> 01:03:04,68
So I am a physical chemist. However I do a lot of physics math architecture and biology and medicine research.

453
01:03:04,7 --> 01:03:15,75
Why that is possible is that. I feel that none of these disciplines alone capable of addressing.

454
01:03:15,77 --> 01:03:24,39
Tomorrow's questions adequately or have the tools to do it in the most efficient way.

455
01:03:25,63 --> 01:03:39,92
So I feel that when I can combine in my group I try to bring mathematicians physicists chemists medical doctors

456
01:03:39,92 --> 01:03:41,55
and designers together.

457
01:03:41,74 --> 01:03:53,91
The goal for that is to think about the way these people would address science in unusual ways just to give you a very

458
01:03:53,92 --> 01:04:05,16
simple demonstration of that if if one wants to describe. Why this butterfly has these beautiful colors.

459
01:04:05,2 --> 01:04:13,21
Actually you pretty much need to know optics physics and optics alone will describe what is happening

460
01:04:13,21 --> 01:04:20,42
but this it with this butterfly. However. All our technological changes.

461
01:04:20,43 --> 01:04:26,1
All the improvements that we had were due to the fact that. OK Were understand optics.

462
01:04:26,36 --> 01:04:37,99
But what if I now use my chemistry knowledge and I encrypt chemical information inside this structure. What if.

463
01:04:38,00 --> 01:04:44,56
Now this. Optical devise would have different chemistries in different locations.

464
01:04:44,58 --> 01:04:50,78
So without chemistry pretty much anything that we've done with this material would be absolutely impossible.

465
01:04:51,14 --> 01:04:57,94
Suddenly chemistry gave a nice spread of of applications

466
01:04:57,94 --> 01:05:06,44
and possibilities that optics physics alone couldn't do chemistry alone also couldn't do it so chemistry was physics

467
01:05:06,44 --> 01:05:17,08
with optics gave an interesting outcome but then. Yet another area. Having fluid mechanics assist in micro.

468
01:05:17,1 --> 01:05:21,67
Brought the ideas of how liquids.

469
01:05:21,68 --> 01:05:27,01
That would infiltrate these structures can move around in interesting ways

470
01:05:27,93 --> 01:05:38,94
and in this way to create interesting unusual changes in color and response to environment so. In my opinion.

471
01:05:39,83 --> 01:05:52,85
It's very important for kids for a future still have very clear Depp's in some traditional disciplines.

472
01:05:52,86 --> 01:05:59,32
I would if I were now to. Have very high school student.

473
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:09,41
Choosing what to do I would say begin with choosing one discipline that you will learn very deeply as your first degree.

474
01:06:09,43 --> 01:06:16,87
Then special for those who are interested in science and will stay in science. I as a Ph D.

475
01:06:16,87 --> 01:06:23,17
Work where I would them create teams of different backgrounds coming together

476
01:06:24,02 --> 01:06:33,65
and learning something from another community that you alone would know otherwise so this bringing together expertise

477
01:06:33,66 --> 01:06:46,15
is I think the future and. I hope that we will see more and more. Papers and knowledge is that a clear outcome of.

478
01:06:46,17 --> 01:06:51,96
Multiple disciplines contributing to. To the overall design.
