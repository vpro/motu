1
00:00:01,19 --> 00:00:03,2
So describe your first trip.

2
00:00:04,72 --> 00:00:12,38
So the reason why I came to be like Randy you have to find it a bit earlier this is in one thousand nine hundred ninety

3
00:00:12,38 --> 00:00:14,12
nine we have a meeting in mom per year.

4
00:00:14,2 --> 00:00:19,31
This is out of friends and this is a meeting of people dealing with research on longevity.

5
00:00:19,97 --> 00:00:30,38
And they are very attentive to validation which means that if these old person are really so all tense all these are

6
00:00:30,38 --> 00:00:35,97
demographic and so margin it isn't and medical doctor. So at that meeting. You know over ninety nine.

7
00:00:36,24 --> 00:00:40,57
From Sardinia did the presentation

8
00:00:40,57 --> 00:00:48,47
and in this presentation the Explain that in the neuro province where we are either in the neural proteins the number

9
00:00:48,47 --> 00:00:49,88
of made centenarian

10
00:00:49,88 --> 00:01:00,23
and female centenarian is about the same we were really skeptical white because all over the world us five six even ten

11
00:01:00,23 --> 00:01:07,25
times more female centenarian compared to maid centenarian So if you have a place where you have the same number.

12
00:01:07,3 --> 00:01:11,6
It means that probably the male as exaggerate their age.

13
00:01:11,63 --> 00:01:16,22
So they have declared that they are one hundred but they are not one hundred.

14
00:01:16,44 --> 00:01:23,11
So it was clear I remember the coffee break there and during the coffee Reg They say we need to send somebody.
