1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:11,22
Why did you actually get your shoes. But. Yeah that's a good question and many different areas. I could have picked.

2
00:00:11,24 --> 00:00:23,86
But I had a very good professor. Who. Total how actually. Plans to get sick.

3
00:00:23,88 --> 00:00:32,53
Like humans like kind of man's plants also get a lot of disease bacterial diseases viral diseases.

4
00:00:32,55 --> 00:00:35,05
Fungal diseases made out of diseases

5
00:00:35,05 --> 00:00:44,49
and they get sick then we have no food so that was really in a simplified a way that was the reason

6
00:00:44,49 --> 00:00:52,68
and I found it very interesting also the science of plant pathology which is diseases of plants. Yeah.

7
00:00:53,53 --> 00:01:02,78
You went from you say that you. You went to the shelter. What did you do and so yeah. So I studied in.

8
00:01:02,8 --> 00:01:11,92
My undergraduate degree in Europe. Yes and I go to scholarship went to the United States.

9
00:01:11,92 --> 00:01:21,21
That's what I really wanted to do and so I studied there and I had. I did my master's degree and my Ph D.

10
00:01:21,21 --> 00:01:34,17
Degree in America and I had also After my Ph D. I had a job as a scientist in in the U.S. In Cornell University and.

11
00:01:34,18 --> 00:01:41,76
So after that I was recruited by an international agricultural research center based in Colombia.

12
00:01:42,89 --> 00:01:49,41
So I had never been in Colombia before. They approached me to consider a job there.

13
00:01:50,32 --> 00:01:57,03
So I was employed by the organization as a senior scientist and then I moved in Colombia. Yeah.

14
00:01:57,28 --> 00:02:06,99
What are you doing in Colombia so I was. A senior scientist in charge of. Diseases so for. Forage plants.

15
00:02:07,01 --> 00:02:17,11
And it's a very enjoyable. Sitting job. Because everything we did was to sort of problem for society.

16
00:02:18,17 --> 00:02:27,97
Particularly for developing countries. It's a great phase for me and I get to learn a new language the Spanish.

17
00:02:28,62 --> 00:02:30,1
The people are nice and.

18
00:02:30,59 --> 00:02:37,36
The country is beautiful and I made my husband say it also he was at the same time

19
00:02:37,36 --> 00:02:46,07
when I was recruited from United States the same company acquitted him also from the Netherlands from his country

20
00:02:46,79 --> 00:02:53,01
and we made. One day apart. We arrived late and one day apart physically.

21
00:02:54,03 --> 00:03:02,31
Saw him and then our daughter was also born there in Colombia. So.

22
00:03:03,41 --> 00:03:09,66
Both of us also grew our scientists this was in the organization also so it is it is very good

23
00:03:09,66 --> 00:03:20,48
and we we I felt we made a lot of difference for people so we were working for basically develop the developing world

24
00:03:20,48 --> 00:03:26,34
in South America in Asia in Africa just based in Colombia.

25
00:03:26,38 --> 00:03:33,76
So it was a very good time and you also educated a lot of Chinese students. Yes So you became a friend of China.

26
00:03:33,84 --> 00:03:46,13
Yes I did so I think one of the exciting things is that. In that organization. You are a scientist.

27
00:03:47,16 --> 00:03:50,5
For any developing countries that needs your skills and technology.

28
00:03:51,00 --> 00:03:58,75
So you are not particularly working for just one country will be as are so many different students graduate students

29
00:03:58,75 --> 00:04:03,3
came to work. With me so was many Chinese.

30
00:04:04,65 --> 00:04:15,13
So the Chinese were partially funded by their government so they came to do research in my love what I told him says

31
00:04:15,14 --> 00:04:16,45
they are really hardworking people

32
00:04:17,47 --> 00:04:26,2
and I spend a considerable amount of time also training them so that was my one of the success so nice

33
00:04:26,2 --> 00:04:32,58
and I had Colombian students I had but I was Elian so I had many different countries. So so so.

34
00:04:34,88 --> 00:04:42,85
The Chinese It wasn't unnoticed that you educated emotional people you got a call from the Chinese.

35
00:04:45,73 --> 00:04:53,08
Why did you decide to go to Africa. Yeah. So that's so that does a turning point for me.

36
00:04:53,19 --> 00:05:01,14
So all those years I was in Colombia for fifteen years. So I agree was a scientist was in the organization.

37
00:05:02,36 --> 00:05:07,52
I was promoted also in the organization. So it was for my career.

38
00:05:07,54 --> 00:05:13,42
It was great but at the back of my mind I was also thinking

39
00:05:13,42 --> 00:05:27,67
and I'm really contemplating also what is actually my impact for Africa coming from a from a privileged knowing how

40
00:05:27,67 --> 00:05:39,5
people live separately to make in this meat so I I was only also with that Colombia needs me more than Africa

41
00:05:39,5 --> 00:05:44,41
and needed me but I think the turning point came in September two thousand

42
00:05:44,41 --> 00:05:52,5
and six as Chinese gave me their highest I worked with the Corps

43
00:05:52,5 --> 00:06:04,99
and the French friendship I worked for their own I had played in their. And cultural research development.

44
00:06:05,01 --> 00:06:09,29
And impact basically said was a graduate student so I three

45
00:06:09,29 --> 00:06:15,31
and who have had become very successful scientists is back in China.

46
00:06:16,43 --> 00:06:22,08
So at ceremonies it was a big ceremony here and on the stage

47
00:06:23,85 --> 00:06:30,08
when it was announced at that time for me to have been to have made this this contribution to China. So it was.

48
00:06:31,79 --> 00:06:34,67
It doesn't it's a proud moment for me to almost I was embarrassed.

49
00:06:35,08 --> 00:06:42,4
You know I was from a poor country and I was getting Amidala going to weigh down from the Premier.

50
00:06:42,99 --> 00:06:50,21
China after all the impact made in China and I was questioning with that on the stage.

51
00:06:50,75 --> 00:06:59,32
There's actually China need me more than Africa. So that was the stage actually on the stage right there.

52
00:06:59,32 --> 00:07:11,55
I decided OK I'm going back to Africa so. You became finally in Africa director of instict Institute. One image.

53
00:07:11,81 --> 00:07:23,24
Issue to deal. Yeah. So when I came back to Africa I I was not immediately the head of this institute. So I.

54
00:07:23,77 --> 00:07:33,46
I was recruited by an as an international organization based here in Nairobi to be established agriculture about

55
00:07:33,46 --> 00:07:38,24
technology center for Africa. Funded by the Canadian government.

56
00:07:39,29 --> 00:07:41,38
To the tough job a tough task

57
00:07:41,38 --> 00:07:49,15
but it gave me a push to need to do something from scratch for Africa so I did that for five

58
00:07:49,15 --> 00:07:59,3
and a half years to establish this center became a very successful Center has done a lot of money trend a set up the

59
00:07:59,3 --> 00:08:03,91
program. And so on. So when I was approached by another organization.

60
00:08:04,3 --> 00:08:08,7
If I could take the position of the vice president for programs.

61
00:08:10,57 --> 00:08:19,92
So I accepted that but it does not it was her children ization So I. I was not.

62
00:08:19,93 --> 00:08:22,46
I wanted to go back into them said children is a shame.

63
00:08:22,48 --> 00:08:33,21
So this then this opportunity came to his superior International Center of insect physiology and ecology.

64
00:08:34,18 --> 00:08:42,75
So I accepted that and so he did a perfect place for me was perfect programs what Africa.

65
00:08:43,84 --> 00:08:50,26
So why insects so people often ask me why was a whole lot of Ghana zation for just insects

66
00:08:51,44 --> 00:08:56,95
and why insects that's what he's Alaska. But yeah this is a unique organization.

67
00:08:58,01 --> 00:09:02,71
I think as far as I know the only organization that deals hundred percent on insects.

68
00:09:06,27 --> 00:09:13,2
Because insects are extremely important in our lives they are by far the most diverse and the most.

69
00:09:14,48 --> 00:09:23,78
Abundant animals on earth they playing a very a sort of sea in our lives they if you take beasts.

70
00:09:24,37 --> 00:09:27,6
Zany play a critical role in pollinating articles.

71
00:09:27,98 --> 00:09:41,52
So if we have to disappear tomorrow our food source would be in big big trouble so the they pulling it out of court

72
00:09:41,52 --> 00:09:53,79
crops like these insects also play a critical role as food source. Food for humans and feed for animals.

73
00:09:53,81 --> 00:10:03,86
So about two billion people in Africa or Latin America is. Consume insect source of protein.

74
00:10:03,88 --> 00:10:11,14
As I believe this is also actually a source that has to be mainstreamed citing the globe.

75
00:10:11,33 --> 00:10:30,11
As a good source of high quality protein. Is also beasts. Give us also a lot of things. Food feed. I mean insects woks.

76
00:10:30,13 --> 00:10:36,48
Range of things. Insects also they they have also acknowledged.

77
00:10:36,56 --> 00:10:45,92
Also there are insects that controller's that harmful insects also insects play a role. Also in degrading waste.

78
00:10:47,2 --> 00:10:49,69
Plant waste animal waste and so on.

79
00:10:49,77 --> 00:10:58,99
So in fact if we don't have insects our Oleg would be a lot of critic I mean really mess. With a lot of garbage.

80
00:10:59,00 --> 00:11:07,92
A lot of waste that we put which is not being degraded by. By some microbes and insects.

81
00:11:07,93 --> 00:11:17,36
But unfortunately we're also that insects also are harmful to also to Humans are animals to crops.

82
00:11:17,82 --> 00:11:28,07
They transmit a lot of disease small things like most Skittles killed more people than Every day is and.

83
00:11:28,08 --> 00:11:33,27
You know global conflicts. Put together as well.

84
00:11:33,27 --> 00:11:40,69
It hurts me to think like it was all to take knowledge is we have humans going mankind going to the moon

85
00:11:41,54 --> 00:11:50,17
or going to space and so on. We are unable to defeat a tiny mosquito to have to kill every eighty seconds in Africa.

86
00:11:50,18 --> 00:11:59,11
Children die from from malaria. Or from. Also a lot of. Transmitted Diseases.

87
00:12:00,77 --> 00:12:01,76
And yellow fever

88
00:12:01,76 --> 00:12:13,12
and a lot of the diseases scams that are transmitted through insects the same for animal diseases so so a wide range of

89
00:12:13,12 --> 00:12:18,4
for animal disease is transmitted through insects.

90
00:12:19,3 --> 00:12:26,44
So so climate change climate change is an issue that is Sun Freeport.

91
00:12:26,55 --> 00:12:37,35
For example say is the one to the bank just came out if we don't do deal with climate change by twenty thirty one

92
00:12:37,35 --> 00:12:39,86
hundred million more people who are going to over thirty.

93
00:12:41,03 --> 00:12:47,87
So I think I believe personally that I think one of the biggest impacts of climate change is going to be inside sources.

94
00:12:48,34 --> 00:12:57,45
So instead sort of going through as the only gets warmer insects are going to shift also to you a woman places so a lot

95
00:12:57,45 --> 00:13:02,32
of African problems are going to be also a problem somewhere else as a guess what.

96
00:13:02,35 --> 00:13:12,49
So if we have to do to make the planet livable for us in the many years ahead.

97
00:13:13,44 --> 00:13:19,05
If we have to manage our food security needs security.

98
00:13:19,22 --> 00:13:26,95
If we have to develop the the climate we have to deal so his insects one of the the benefits

99
00:13:27,72 --> 00:13:30,73
and the harmful part of the of what insects.

100
00:13:30,82 --> 00:13:42,45
Will there are people aware somehow of this wide variety of properties that. No unfortunately not.

101
00:13:42,68 --> 00:13:49,26
I think we have to make people aware of of that I think we have to teach it.

102
00:13:49,26 --> 00:13:56,4
You would you mind repeating my question sort of because I want you. Yes or no. Yeah.

103
00:13:56,72 --> 00:14:02,49
So if you think people are aware somehow. Device for right you property.

104
00:14:02,65 --> 00:14:14,07
Yeah no I think people are not aware of of all this variety of issues associated with insects.

105
00:14:15,14 --> 00:14:23,24
So for example if you take beasts. Almost everybody knows that the honey comes from beasts.

106
00:14:24,33 --> 00:14:28,76
But a lot of people don't know that bees are critical.

107
00:14:28,81 --> 00:14:33,24
And so for food security is a they pollinate crops results beasts

108
00:14:33,24 --> 00:14:44,6
and you don't have enough in some of the plants they require pollination by microbes by AS So you know people don't

109
00:14:44,6 --> 00:14:47,32
know a lot of a lot about about this

110
00:14:47,32 --> 00:14:53,69
and I think we have to teach it in school in elementary school in high school in universities

111
00:14:54,76 --> 00:14:56,79
and I think in the general public.

112
00:14:56,8 --> 00:15:08,86
Also to be aware of what insects do for a for people on the other properties you think of very beneficial for insects

113
00:15:10,29 --> 00:15:19,67
pharmaceutical properties. If you will from yeah yeah. Insects play also as a.

114
00:15:19,68 --> 00:15:29,79
For example there are insecticides are uniquely found antibiotics insecticides uniquely produce that have antibiotics

115
00:15:29,79 --> 00:15:35,42
for example should we do it again. Yeah. Yeah. OK mention some other.

116
00:15:35,43 --> 00:15:44,43
Well quite unique properties that we are not very aware. Yeah. Insects have a number of as a uses as well.

117
00:15:45,53 --> 00:15:50,78
For example antibiotics for people for any mouse.

118
00:15:52,38 --> 00:15:58,79
I don't think we have investigated enough the unique kind about except exist in insects.

119
00:16:01,03 --> 00:16:13,07
There are also other things for example this insect called Soldier fly that are very good in in processing a lot of

120
00:16:13,07 --> 00:16:16,75
waste and converting them into fertilizer.

121
00:16:18,08 --> 00:16:29,76
So yeah there's a wide variety of use that we can make out of the out of insects and some of the airplane.

122
00:16:29,78 --> 00:16:40,98
Helicopter design come source of fuel from insect insect architecture that. What do you make use of your interest you.

123
00:16:43,59 --> 00:16:56,6
Yeah I think the uniqueness for me this is one he is focused on really solving.

124
00:16:57,5 --> 00:17:00,7
Agricultural and health constraints in Africa.

125
00:17:02,16 --> 00:17:07,25
But what we produce is not just unique for Africa it can be used globally.

126
00:17:08,17 --> 00:17:18,17
Eighty's also we also focus on very environmentally friendly and sustainable technologies and products.

127
00:17:18,18 --> 00:17:20,35
We have for example.

128
00:17:20,36 --> 00:17:30,89
Over the years generated about besides besides that come naturally for a woman naturally for existing fungus.

129
00:17:30,9 --> 00:17:42,28
And and we manage. Insects beneficial not beneficial harmful insects.

130
00:17:43,18 --> 00:17:50,5
So this products now are commercial is that together with in partnership with the private sector.

131
00:17:50,8 --> 00:17:57,54
And so it's registered now that registered didn't many countries in Africa.

132
00:17:57,56 --> 00:18:01,99
And currently that have been grades are built so. In the European Union.

133
00:18:02,00 --> 00:18:04,9
So what we produce very environmentally friendly

134
00:18:05,98 --> 00:18:10,88
and not contaminating the environment not harming as a beneficial insects.

135
00:18:12,42 --> 00:18:18,49
So it's not only just useful for Africa but this can be used anywhere else as well in Europe in North America.

136
00:18:18,91 --> 00:18:25,82
So we are unique in states that we we focus on technology and products that are environmentally friendly

137
00:18:27,05 --> 00:18:34,26
and that also sustainable for a long time or so and that gives And I actually believe very much so.

138
00:18:35,45 --> 00:18:42,03
I'm bored and this is your institute for Africa. Maybe you despair.

139
00:18:42,05 --> 00:18:54,92
I think is very very important I think I often ask my staff that if we cease to exist tomorrow would be people lined up

140
00:18:54,92 --> 00:19:02,12
asking for. But the opening offer and the answer is constantly Yes.

141
00:19:02,71 --> 00:19:08,61
Because we we are making a major impact all across Africa

142
00:19:09,35 --> 00:19:21,03
and we are focused on major constraints constants that are really. Impediment for agricultural in Hull's. Issues so.

143
00:19:22,47 --> 00:19:30,22
Very important a limitation for the whole of the continent and and globally as well. Why is it in Africa.

144
00:19:30,24 --> 00:19:36,59
Why is it in Africa. Good question. Superiors in Africa because it was founded by Africa.

145
00:19:37,21 --> 00:19:46,51
It was a founded forty five you say go in one thousand seventy by a very renowned in the morning just insect scientist.

146
00:19:48,14 --> 00:19:59,21
Professor A Kenyan professor. So it was founded does as an international standard a small center was in a university.

147
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:09,32
And it expanded it expanded the and so today we have multiple nationalities of scientists and technical staff

148
00:20:13,6 --> 00:20:17,11
and reaching out across Africa and making it back

149
00:20:17,11 --> 00:20:26,24
and what I like about the organization is also that research yeah we do cutting edge research we do.

150
00:20:26,25 --> 00:20:31,74
We make a major Brooks's brick suppose we publish in high quality Jordan and internationally

151
00:20:31,74 --> 00:20:42,03
but all that work is also with him to translate it to impact is nothing we do which is not is a short term

152
00:20:42,03 --> 00:20:43,57
or medium term or long term.

153
00:20:43,82 --> 00:20:52,55
It's not translated to impact and production reach the end user which is the farmers and the beneficiaries in Africa

154
00:20:52,55 --> 00:21:04,58
and beyond. And so. So this is really truly. Making science to work for the for the for people for society.

155
00:21:06,26 --> 00:21:13,73
When you describe how important effect future. Yeah excellent very good question.

156
00:21:13,9 --> 00:21:20,89
Yeah I think insects are really important for our lives. So I think bees.

157
00:21:22,02 --> 00:21:28,88
Europe and North America already knows now because a bee population is going declining already knows that.

158
00:21:30,2 --> 00:21:35,72
This is a problem unless we do this unless we take care of the hulls of the beasts.

159
00:21:38,37 --> 00:21:47,96
So that when I think it was results say that if this if they don't exist today tomorrow we are in trouble. So.

160
00:21:47,97 --> 00:21:53,93
That that has to go on for the future. I think for the future.

161
00:21:54,1 --> 00:21:59,95
Also that if we have to diversify our foods foods source.

162
00:22:01,61 --> 00:22:05,14
Feed source and quality of protein

163
00:22:05,14 --> 00:22:13,58
and thing we have to man is three more so these are insects are as food so that is that out of via the more than two

164
00:22:13,58 --> 00:22:19,34
thousand species of insects are consumed to global. About seven of them in Africa.

165
00:22:19,67 --> 00:22:27,1
So people consume them go to the forests they collect them seasonally.

166
00:22:28,28 --> 00:22:35,24
Often it is women and children who are tasked given these tasks to go to the forests and collect the insects but.

167
00:22:35,25 --> 00:22:42,08
So sometimes when you collect also that you are going to there is a tendency of the to over harvest

168
00:22:42,81 --> 00:22:52,44
and then you can cause some of this at all in balancing the the atmosphere there you can leave liam so.

169
00:22:52,46 --> 00:23:01,19
And he simply has the technology. The capability to masquerade. A lot of this is species of insects.

170
00:23:04,26 --> 00:23:07,76
But I think we have to change the perception of people.

171
00:23:09,2 --> 00:23:16,43
Globally is that the that the insects I mean consuming snakes is not something out of the old ordinary two billion

172
00:23:16,43 --> 00:23:22,55
people have successfully been trying to deny you consuming them. If we have to do mainstream and so.

173
00:23:22,61 --> 00:23:33,9
So the conversion rate also a feed. And insect protein is a lot more efficient in sects.

174
00:23:34,17 --> 00:23:44,12
So with a very limited amount of feed substrate to insects you can get high quality protein compared to the same

175
00:23:44,12 --> 00:23:59,46
quality protein in beef in cattle. So for climate change. Also mitigation for. And so on so I think it's a sad move.

176
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:03,89
More compatible I think more sustainable.

177
00:24:03,91 --> 00:24:13,71
One of your research actually published an article about locust you could better locust food. Yeah.

178
00:24:14,06 --> 00:24:20,83
Can you explain what was what. Yeah. So we we have been working going now.

179
00:24:20,84 --> 00:24:24,3
All the various insects also the protein

180
00:24:24,3 --> 00:24:32,49
and nutritional profile of these insects also a number of insects that are being consumed traditionally So we found

181
00:24:32,49 --> 00:24:40,27
that a lot of this insects actually have a higher or equivalent content of nutrition

182
00:24:40,27 --> 00:24:48,54
and protein to be equivalent to fish and you beef is that is a good finding locusts.

183
00:24:48,92 --> 00:24:53,03
So we published recently about two months ago.

184
00:24:53,05 --> 00:25:02,55
Very exciting finding so locusts are really big pests they go and they can name a storm

185
00:25:02,55 --> 00:25:10,82
and they can completely wipe your crops in an overnight they consume are a lot of greenery crops or any vegetation.

186
00:25:12,18 --> 00:25:17,9
But but people also consume them traditionally And so in many parts of Africa and elsewhere so

187
00:25:17,91 --> 00:25:30,61
but what we found is that not because they love what I thought they say things that are feed on seedlings they they

188
00:25:30,61 --> 00:25:36,24
they they convert the with seedlings may have very minute amount of steroids.

189
00:25:36,26 --> 00:25:42,56
This had chemicals that are very useful to to our health release cholesterol and they do a lot.

190
00:25:42,66 --> 00:25:45,75
They have a lot of benefits to our health.

191
00:25:46,65 --> 00:25:53,35
And so they look us as a consumer and then they we don't know the mechanisms there yet.

192
00:25:53,51 --> 00:25:59,79
They have the in capacity to convert this. Steroids twenty to forty.

193
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:04,88
And so if you have a diet low cost the business right.

194
00:26:06,11 --> 00:26:14,14
All across in your life incorporated into your diet that the chance of you having a store owner as that hurt.

195
00:26:14,17 --> 00:26:15,45
Problem is much much lower.

196
00:26:16,56 --> 00:26:22,59
So this is a amazing finding it so I think it's more

197
00:26:22,59 --> 00:26:30,96
and more of who we are in the day the beneficial effect of Hull's beneficial effect of insects. As food.

198
00:26:31,18 --> 00:26:37,75
I think the perception of people or so. We change and on incorporating it into the apply.

199
00:26:37,93 --> 00:26:43,89
So if you inject research you do for the future of Africa.

200
00:26:45,83 --> 00:26:55,06
I think if we have effective effectively understanding we are constantly understanding the insects as their physiology

201
00:26:55,06 --> 00:27:03,06
is a recall of disease where they are mechanism how they transmitted diseases like that there are fascinating questions

202
00:27:03,07 --> 00:27:04,04
for critters.

203
00:27:05,4 --> 00:27:14,15
If we understand that our better if we know then we identified in several cycles sin their life cycle several spots

204
00:27:14,15 --> 00:27:22,2
where the weak spots where we can manage. So I think we have to eradicate malaria. So why can't we.

205
00:27:22,28 --> 00:27:27,05
With all this technology not just us but the global. Scientific community.

206
00:27:27,23 --> 00:27:34,81
Why can't we eradicate dengue a way country eradicate says they fly south that causing a lot of problem was in humans

207
00:27:34,81 --> 00:27:43,81
in the nineteen months on was so so I think if we tackle all this. I think the future of Africa will be bright.

208
00:27:44,17 --> 00:27:46,54
It will be less nice problem to deal with.

209
00:27:47,45 --> 00:27:55,74
So a lot of the problems you find in Africa there are that actually manageable we can manage them. We can tackle them.

210
00:27:57,14 --> 00:28:09,26
So it's not this not. Yeah we. We regularly make bricks or as we recently that the younger group of scientists is.

211
00:28:09,65 --> 00:28:20,84
Sippin my organization. They they've discovered that certain tools certain population of the most transmit malaria.

212
00:28:22,27 --> 00:28:35,46
About a very small portion of them. We don't know why they they harbor. Bacteria in their body so that. These.

213
00:28:36,17 --> 00:28:44,33
These bacteria as they are the Unable to transmit the malaria parasite. That is a major major discovery.

214
00:28:44,35 --> 00:28:50,67
So what we have well what we are doing is that why. Why do what does.

215
00:28:50,68 --> 00:28:54,86
What do these bacteria do to this insect is making them resistant.

216
00:28:55,3 --> 00:29:03,87
And incapable of transmitting the the malaria transmitting the the malaria parasite.

217
00:29:03,89 --> 00:29:08,96
And why only certain population a certain percentage of them are in the musky to have it.

218
00:29:10,32 --> 00:29:20,56
So if we know that and if we are able to to transmit this bacteria to a wider range of the population.

219
00:29:22,2 --> 00:29:26,18
It is possible to significantly reduces their malaria to that transmission.

220
00:29:26,79 --> 00:29:34,89
So there's a lot of things we can do and we. And I make to make a difference in Africa and it's.

221
00:29:35,73 --> 00:29:49,49
People I talk to say you would examine. That. Have been hairy men hairy and very impatient. Yeah because I think and I.

222
00:29:49,5 --> 00:29:55,39
If you talk to my staff also they will tell you the same thing. I mean I am where I'm pushing going to Santa Lee.

223
00:29:55,72 --> 00:29:59,69
I mean patient that is because I think we have to.

224
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:08,68
Live our lives with a sense of urgency because every day we leave that to morrow we have an hour.

225
00:30:08,68 --> 00:30:16,99
Where are about to finish today tomorrow. We have one day less than the life of a lifetime.

226
00:30:18,75 --> 00:30:20,75
So which means that we are not getting younger.

227
00:30:21,71 --> 00:30:31,6
So we have to rush to make sure that we have actually make a difference in people's lives that we have lived also our

228
00:30:31,6 --> 00:30:36,62
lives with a purpose. So I think we shouldn't do. I don't feel that I have to live for myself.

229
00:30:37,66 --> 00:30:46,89
No I shouldn't live for myself I should feel a sense of responsibility for my as a fellow human beings that is so so

230
00:30:46,89 --> 00:30:48,00
that's why I'm in a hurry.

231
00:30:48,06 --> 00:30:56,9
I'm really no hurry to go I want to do I want to do law is something I want to make a difference for people.

232
00:30:57,04 --> 00:31:02,66
I went to solve problems.

233
00:31:03,08 --> 00:31:10,17
For poor people who are not able to solve it seems obvious and I think we are fortunate as a scientist.

234
00:31:10,36 --> 00:31:15,99
I'm fortunate that I'm given this priceless knowledge and education.

235
00:31:17,82 --> 00:31:26,53
So I have to use it to know the use it to publish a paper with only to really to use to serve the people's problems

236
00:31:28,27 --> 00:31:36,22
and Chinese do for Africa. All science can do a lot of things will Africa and for the rest of the world.

237
00:31:36,25 --> 00:31:50,31
I think we should do we should be able to find solutions for all our for our we should be finding vaccine for malaria.

238
00:31:50,62 --> 00:31:59,82
We should be finding vaccine for a child. Who should be defending cancer. So that's one possible.

239
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:06,47
I think is so is science can do a lot of different things to for people and for the planet. What can.

240
00:32:06,83 --> 00:32:11,75
Africa doofus write. Africa can do. Oh a lot of things for science.

241
00:32:11,8 --> 00:32:15,15
I think that's an excellent question that no one has ever asked

242
00:32:15,15 --> 00:32:26,89
and I think governments have to value this Heins technology is a really important for the continent development for the

243
00:32:26,89 --> 00:32:30,49
people so they have to value that.

244
00:32:31,12 --> 00:32:39,69
They have to invest a significant proportion of their of their resources to science and technology.

245
00:32:39,71 --> 00:32:44,35
And to as an area it's because I think the difference between my country

246
00:32:44,35 --> 00:32:53,18
and your country which is my husband's country is really not the difference in our color. It's not the difference in.

247
00:32:53,2 --> 00:33:00,14
In the location where Riyad it's a difference of capability and education.

248
00:33:00,32 --> 00:33:05,67
So that and investment and a capability capacity of people to you know of it.

249
00:33:05,73 --> 00:33:14,78
Capacity of people to abse or with new technologies. And to invent a lot of different things.

250
00:33:15,01 --> 00:33:21,04
If we don't do that if Africa doesn't desire never going to solve a lot of our problems.

251
00:33:21,7 --> 00:33:31,4
So how is it that their misery lands which has a miserable Whizzer. And can produce a lot of food food.

252
00:33:31,65 --> 00:33:36,79
Not only for these people but I think can produce a lot and we have this beautiful weather.

253
00:33:37,43 --> 00:33:46,89
Beautiful sunshine and a lot of resources water and everything else and we're not feeding ourselves.

254
00:33:46,91 --> 00:33:51,15
So it is again a capability I think if you will for me.

255
00:33:51,16 --> 00:34:02,19
You know and knowledge and and technology and I think Africa has to do that to you. To enhance it is our ability to do.

256
00:34:03,33 --> 00:34:12,56
What can your and should you do for Africa. We do our does a lot of things for Africa.

257
00:34:14,11 --> 00:34:17,58
So we are in line with what I have just say.

258
00:34:17,59 --> 00:34:27,23
We believe capacity is very critical capacity at the end of the day capacity is development development is all about

259
00:34:27,23 --> 00:34:33,63
capacity of people. So we have a very large capacity building unit.

260
00:34:34,23 --> 00:34:45,07
So every year we see one hundred to one hundred fifty graduate students all across Africa they do they do they do mass

261
00:34:45,07 --> 00:34:47,35
that we have a master's degree they are a Ph D.

262
00:34:47,35 --> 00:34:54,95
Degree so and then we train them they are registering in many different universities

263
00:34:54,95 --> 00:34:56,77
but they do the research at this a bit.

264
00:34:57,38 --> 00:35:06,58
And so we are in Hans seeing the scientific capability of many African countries own insect science

265
00:35:08,57 --> 00:35:19,07
but also we train also a lot of farmers in different things. We we train in the technology certainly adopt from us.

266
00:35:20,8 --> 00:35:26,04
And so on. So like this year from John already until October.

267
00:35:26,83 --> 00:35:34,3
Tandems this is a ten month as we we three and one of them ten thousand people in various different acknowledged.

268
00:35:34,53 --> 00:35:44,99
So this is big. And we have a lot of the small organization. So I think this is a big contribution. So we we also.

269
00:35:46,01 --> 00:35:50,41
Our products go look up. Technologists to go.

270
00:35:51,25 --> 00:35:59,82
So one of the things which is difficult for us is to scale lots of technologies to reach as many people as we can. So.

271
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:06,96
What example we have the technologists you are going to visit tomorrow in the field is a absolutely fabulous technology.

272
00:36:08,48 --> 00:36:13,88
Invented created by and developed by its partners.

273
00:36:13,9 --> 00:36:19,41
But this is a technology that is really needed all across Africa but be bad.

274
00:36:19,43 --> 00:36:24,97
We are reaching only ten to twenty thousand people far more spread a year

275
00:36:25,9 --> 00:36:28,56
but the technology is needed by millions of foreigners.

276
00:36:29,87 --> 00:36:35,46
So now we are changing our model and partner noting with governments and with any just

277
00:36:35,46 --> 00:36:44,16
and was a private sector to take the technology into accelerated in many different countries. Yeah.

278
00:36:46,13 --> 00:36:50,79
You're not a different discussion. To many people share your sort.

279
00:36:51,89 --> 00:36:58,18
Wherever you can share because you also go to the president of your country or yeah so.

280
00:36:58,36 --> 00:37:06,81
So yeah this is a very important we are not it's very important for us to because the governments and to fit also with.

281
00:37:09,13 --> 00:37:13,8
Strategy plan also so we kind of just want Korean isolation.

282
00:37:13,94 --> 00:37:20,94
So that utopian government has for example has a very clear strategy development plan.

283
00:37:21,79 --> 00:37:30,9
So they took a number of our products and technologists and they fit them into their into their strategy.

284
00:37:30,92 --> 00:37:38,93
For one of our technologies for example they have a plan to reach minimum of twenty thousand farmers with that

285
00:37:38,93 --> 00:37:43,64
technology a year. So they are going to expand it themselves.

286
00:37:43,74 --> 00:37:50,41
I think once a gives up and we do the technical backstopping. Because it's a very knowledge intensive technology.

287
00:37:51,28 --> 00:37:59,28
So you have to train farmers. How to to to use it but it's a fabulous technology and a beekeeping so that.

288
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:09,3
They utilize beekeeping anything insects that we work on silk farming also is very needed so it's not just only food

289
00:38:09,3 --> 00:38:15,55
security but also income generation you want to improve the livelihood of people in various ways.

290
00:38:15,57 --> 00:38:22,37
It's not just only producing more food and that's it. But you want also to diversify their income.

291
00:38:22,73 --> 00:38:32,28
That reduces the risk mitigation so if you have a diverse income. You are you are not dependent on one.

292
00:38:32,3 --> 00:38:42,04
So you're already seeing this discount so yeah. So what would be your ultimate scientific goal.

293
00:38:42,06 --> 00:38:58,38
OK that's a big question I think. A more doable one. So I think so. Tomorrow you would see this field visits.

294
00:38:58,4 --> 00:39:11,9
In the field one of the critical critical problems across Africa in many countries is a parasitic weed called Strike it

295
00:39:11,9 --> 00:39:22,64
is a parasite on many cereal crops on rice on maize on sort of Gram one million the staples that people need staple

296
00:39:22,64 --> 00:39:28,57
food. And basically this is a part of it at that seed self.

297
00:39:30,66 --> 00:39:37,64
To the roots of its host is a maze of sort of them or whatever it takes all the nutrients out.

298
00:39:39,09 --> 00:39:46,86
It cannot live without without that host. And visit. So if you have that.

299
00:39:47,26 --> 00:39:54,87
It also produces a lot of seeds like thousands of seeds tiny seeds and it sheds into the soil

300
00:39:55,99 --> 00:40:00,35
and so once you have started this is really the soil is busy. Unusable.

301
00:40:02,1 --> 00:40:05,24
So we have a technologist at the cutting eradicate that.

302
00:40:05,25 --> 00:40:12,75
So what I really would like to see in my lifetime is eradicating the say weed from all across Africa

303
00:40:13,46 --> 00:40:17,48
and it's possible we have the technology what is needed is to scale it out.

304
00:40:18,68 --> 00:40:21,86
To get the large law and number of partners and

305
00:40:22,56 --> 00:40:30,61
and funders to say OK we are out to eradicate descend then we have to go into a major problem food security probably

306
00:40:30,61 --> 00:40:37,69
put Africa. I would like to see that was in my lifetime. And I think it's doable.

307
00:40:37,7 --> 00:40:41,32
How important are the insects for more sustainable.

308
00:40:41,79 --> 00:40:52,74
And that are very important in many young girls there are important. If you manage them well that important in.

309
00:40:52,75 --> 00:41:05,86
Cleaning our environment that important in and being the watercourse of farms that important as food source.

310
00:41:06,89 --> 00:41:17,53
I mean all these. Chicken that are sold as the organic chicken that are free roaming in the. In the Fathom.

311
00:41:17,82 --> 00:41:28,6
Why do they dig and dig and they pick since it's so you might you can mass produce that and produce a bigger chicken.

312
00:41:29,22 --> 00:41:36,19
And more so in a more sustainable way. Fishery aqua culture.

313
00:41:37,52 --> 00:41:46,54
That's more so as well so insects can play a critical role in. In a more sustainable production system.

314
00:41:47,44 --> 00:41:53,61
So I can go on and when I think really important. Yeah that's important in.

315
00:41:53,63 --> 00:41:59,51
But also enjoy because you want a more sustainable Africa. Yes.

316
00:42:00,9 --> 00:42:08,78
So I think they they have even more so here because we have me rather for diversity of insects as diversity of ecology

317
00:42:08,78 --> 00:42:17,56
say our ecology cult zones are be that of varieties that are a lot of different plants. All year round.

318
00:42:18,04 --> 00:42:26,31
So a lot of these insects also they rely on own. Planned sugar source. As their thing.

319
00:42:27,22 --> 00:42:32,83
So I see many people don't know what skittles they don't just go and take my blend

320
00:42:32,83 --> 00:42:42,74
and they live on that they need to specific or so to sustain them specific plant can take that as a source of.

321
00:42:42,76 --> 00:42:52,69
Sugar is this is so I detect more so for Africa because of our diversity of ecology diversity of plants diversity of of

322
00:42:52,69 --> 00:42:57,33
things. We just we keep discovering new things this year alone.

323
00:42:58,79 --> 00:43:04,42
We discovered and published out attack on attacks on our mists and partners.

324
00:43:04,44 --> 00:43:11,9
Fifteen different new wasps which have never been described in anywhere in the winter

325
00:43:12,63 --> 00:43:23,68
and there are some of them that are also beneficial because they feed on harmful insects. We have discovered. So in.

326
00:43:23,7 --> 00:43:36,17
Where we are going tomorrow. One of our scientists is to discover that there is a jumping spider jumping spider.

327
00:43:36,19 --> 00:43:49,55
That is attracted only to. That that are filled with blood with human blood. So they jump and if you don't do side.

328
00:43:49,6 --> 00:43:57,84
Insects. If you give them. As that insects. They they wouldn't say go specifically full stop was good.

329
00:43:58,13 --> 00:44:11,8
But they are a lot smaller scale. With that specific jumping spider also requires subtlety and plant. Sugar source.

330
00:44:12,09 --> 00:44:19,5
To sustain it also between its means. Skittle blood filled mosquitoes. We call it via vampire spiders.

331
00:44:20,2 --> 00:44:30,72
As so what it means is also that if you keep. So Stipe of plants in your habitat. You are going to manage also.

332
00:44:30,74 --> 00:44:35,9
To keep the brain more so that the art of maintaining the spiders that feed on your the mosquitoes.

333
00:44:36,54 --> 00:44:47,89
That will be less mosquitoes to transmit. Out all it is not in black and white. It's not in in boxes. It's a continuum.

334
00:44:48,55 --> 00:44:54,52
So we have to manage it doesn't continue to make it very stressed and never. Very natural.

335
00:44:56,78 --> 00:44:57,82
For the future

336
00:44:57,82 --> 00:45:06,51
and so if you cause imbalance too by eliminating certain type of insects from more certain type of plants.

337
00:45:07,6 --> 00:45:11,38
Then they just. You are causing also an imbalance in your environment.

338
00:45:12,72 --> 00:45:19,79
What would be the way to go from Africa disrespect I mean you have say to European agricultural system

339
00:45:19,79 --> 00:45:29,99
or like to us is that the way to go for what you. Yeah. That was an excellent question.

340
00:45:30,35 --> 00:45:35,49
But also a complicated question. And I so you can debate it is a way.

341
00:45:36,26 --> 00:45:45,34
OK you can debate it is the way because while and so for example seventy percent of.

342
00:45:46,74 --> 00:45:53,2
Generally sixty to seventy percent of the population in in Africa is engaged in agriculture.

343
00:45:54,28 --> 00:46:01,58
I don't think that is a smart way to keep that a large proportion of the. Your population in far me.

344
00:46:02,9 --> 00:46:10,44
So if you go Europe or North America and Canada you have about four or five percent of the population.

345
00:46:11,67 --> 00:46:19,26
So it is very inefficient to to have seventy percent of your population to read at least.

346
00:46:19,28 --> 00:46:24,02
So this is not efficient way to do it. So we have to do it better.

347
00:46:24,19 --> 00:46:32,18
So also but I think technology scientific technology alone is not going to do the trick.

348
00:46:33,98 --> 00:46:41,22
So we have to have the right policy. We have to have a right environment to do these things.

349
00:46:41,48 --> 00:46:50,39
Why do I say policy policy is is important in this because it has to be the right policy to land.

350
00:46:50,73 --> 00:46:57,01
And access to land access to resources. So if you take.

351
00:46:59,12 --> 00:47:06,47
For example many African countries without the mentioning a specific country. You have land.

352
00:47:07,02 --> 00:47:10,73
The farmers has to begin is very small land.

353
00:47:11,59 --> 00:47:20,05
So they have a farmer may have six seven children father mother dies the six seven children split their land.

354
00:47:20,94 --> 00:47:27,33
So these are one of them can make a living out of such pieces. Small pieces of land.

355
00:47:28,54 --> 00:47:33,96
So we have to have a policy to to stop fragmenting the the land.

356
00:47:34,34 --> 00:47:41,55
To pieces because it cannot make a living out of it you can transform agriculture was small pieces.

357
00:47:41,92 --> 00:47:57,32
You cannot do a lot of different things so so so so that has to be a policy also that is favorable to two to enabling a

358
00:47:57,32 --> 00:47:59,87
transformation of agriculture through should.

359
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:08,54
Be a big to produce more was was less so and we have to make out I'd like our share is more efficient

360
00:48:09,62 --> 00:48:22,65
and utilization i also a lot of proportion of the out of farming system is when Fed that's not so son of a new way.

361
00:48:23,28 --> 00:48:31,85
To wait for the rain waiting in the sky for a drop of water to drop sads and it's a smart way to do

362
00:48:31,85 --> 00:48:39,49
and only four percent of our land is all of the farmland is it a gated

363
00:48:40,34 --> 00:48:47,42
and yet we have a lot of water flowing in it will have a lot of also water. Being waste with the dough so this whole.

364
00:48:47,82 --> 00:48:57,02
There's a lot of different things that we have to do to. To to transform our farming system.

365
00:48:57,22 --> 00:49:07,19
So having said that this is not. I don't believe that one more deal. Alone is the model for Africa.

366
00:49:09,09 --> 00:49:17,03
So it may not be the European model but there are a lot of things we can go from. I dropped from the European.

367
00:49:17,99 --> 00:49:24,47
Land access to the sort of efficiency in part of me and so on.

368
00:49:26,78 --> 00:49:35,14
So it's it's not the it's not the black and white times that I can give you.

369
00:49:35,76 --> 00:49:36,18
But

370
00:49:36,18 --> 00:49:44,22
but what I know is that we cannot continue keeping a large population of the population percentage of out of provisioning

371
00:49:44,22 --> 00:49:57,29
for me that's just not doable system if you imagine a future where the knowledge about insects will be short of export

372
00:49:57,29 --> 00:50:05,11
product for. A. Yes actually. Yes there are you can repeat my question.

373
00:50:05,59 --> 00:50:19,23
Yeah and OK well what kind of future and do injections have for and so can we use insects as Africa use insects

374
00:50:19,23 --> 00:50:28,02
or exports but a duck. Yes absolutely. I believe so. This is not actually even.

375
00:50:28,04 --> 00:50:31,61
Something for the long run but it's already short track.

376
00:50:31,68 --> 00:50:45,45
There are companies that are already exploring to establish a plant here in Africa to produce mass grave insects.

377
00:50:45,85 --> 00:50:53,68
For a feed. To Europe and somewhere else. So yeah this is going to happen in the near future.

378
00:50:53,9 --> 00:51:03,66
Actually you know maybe you can sort of give it a compressed answer on how important interactions are in terms of

379
00:51:03,66 --> 00:51:10,54
danger. You know like what you said to many there are many deaths caused by injection.

380
00:51:10,77 --> 00:51:16,04
Many more by malaria and the other kind of

381
00:51:16,05 --> 00:51:26,49
but also beneficial things so little bit of sort of breast cancer that appeared to do what they said yeah OK.

382
00:51:26,5 --> 00:51:34,15
So if you would have to tell a nice story about one insects are meaningful to me and for us.

383
00:51:35,58 --> 00:51:44,67
What will be your story line. Yeah be very very important for them for. For humankind.

384
00:51:46,33 --> 00:51:48,95
So we have to protect beasts resulted.

385
00:51:49,3 --> 00:52:03,27
So we have to make sure that they are healthy and they leave nice nicely happily and. There are many ways to do that.

386
00:52:03,29 --> 00:52:06,97
Phil and.

387
00:52:07,84 --> 00:52:11,82
They need to have good pollen plant source

388
00:52:11,82 --> 00:52:20,79
and so on so beside number one I think they're bad among the top which we need to do not predict have sprayed it at

389
00:52:20,79 --> 00:52:30,7
insects sad really important does what we did that to feed on harmful insects that hadn't put people to our animals.

390
00:52:30,77 --> 00:52:41,55
It's not important as well so. But tatting we have to or so. Pay attention and try. So you.

391
00:52:42,06 --> 00:52:53,34
That advocate they'll find a solution also so you owe me rather for major diseases that are transmitted by by insects

392
00:52:54,62 --> 00:53:03,72
keep those. Like it is that transmitted to malaria. That transmits dengue.

393
00:53:04,35 --> 00:53:11,67
That Transmeta also a number of causes the disease was in i months and humans. Rift Valley fever.

394
00:53:13,15 --> 00:53:26,29
Yellow fever and the number of other diseases etc for Africa says if life says he flies. Really quickly got money many.

395
00:53:26,31 --> 00:53:39,27
For to land. Thailand in Africa has become you know abandoned by people because of this is if life infestation.

396
00:53:39,66 --> 00:53:41,67
So this adult to very important.

397
00:53:41,7 --> 00:53:52,37
All these things I have described saddled so focused will be sipping my organisation to do so as this are some of the

398
00:53:52,37 --> 00:53:59,89
important thing. So I would say yeah we were called to school so. Take six and take one disease.

399
00:54:01,12 --> 00:54:07,2
This are not just after a couple of nepotism because America has a little demand we have products in the pipeline.

400
00:54:07,79 --> 00:54:14,91
That that really fictive natural products from from plants. As other microbes was in Africa.

401
00:54:15,02 --> 00:54:17,4
So I think the beauty of it is.

402
00:54:19,04 --> 00:54:23,23
Is Africa has a lot of this problem insect program

403
00:54:23,23 --> 00:54:29,81
but the whole lot of also sort of sort of for controlling this so for all of these problems that I have indicated.

404
00:54:30,46 --> 00:54:39,95
Like this is it flies we have a product for example which came from the wildlife wild animals in Aden in Africa.

405
00:54:39,97 --> 00:54:47,92
So much. I have a feeling that you're introducing has a lot of hidden treasures I don't. Yes we do it yeah absolutely.

406
00:54:48,38 --> 00:54:50,18
Yes it's going to can you repeat it. Yeah.

407
00:54:50,62 --> 00:55:02,85
And disappear I think has a lot of important unique three ships that that's not widely known.

408
00:55:05,22 --> 00:55:15,58
But I think also we had a making tremendous effort to you for the rest of the world to to know what we are capable of

409
00:55:15,58 --> 00:55:24,27
being and what we have. So and I think also I have to also indicate that. The Superior does it is.

410
00:55:25,45 --> 00:55:28,63
Also work with a lot of partners and nobody. So we have.

411
00:55:29,23 --> 00:55:37,27
More than three hundred partners in Europe North America Latin America swim and we're.

412
00:55:37,89 --> 00:55:43,81
Including then eleven months we have a lot of parts to say and so so yeah. So how do you get these treasures.

413
00:55:44,04 --> 00:55:52,42
Into the world. Yet lots is a critical large think it's critical to scale out what we have so that.

414
00:55:53,64 --> 00:56:02,28
The rest of the planet can and Africa can make use of what we have. At a faster rate and that is a challenge.

415
00:56:02,42 --> 00:56:05,15
That's a big challenge because it is sort of the musician.

416
00:56:05,68 --> 00:56:10,75
Is it is said to the musician and it's very difficult for the search organization to scale out.

417
00:56:11,42 --> 00:56:22,41
And to reach out to the Globe on a global forum on a global platform and so partners become very important

418
00:56:23,26 --> 00:56:27,03
and funding becomes important source of funding. Our funding.

419
00:56:28,26 --> 00:56:35,39
We are not a government organization we are we have international organizations that happen to be based in Kenya.

420
00:56:35,41 --> 00:56:47,17
So the funding comes from a lot of the sources that you. So the European Union is among the investors the donors.

421
00:56:48,71 --> 00:56:54,41
The governments of. Of Germany Sweden Souza London and U.K.

422
00:56:56,03 --> 00:57:01,88
Money foundations the provide funding for us to make that excellent make a change.

423
00:57:02,05 --> 00:57:10,3
So I think all these resources I think have to be made available not just what Africa

424
00:57:10,3 --> 00:57:16,65
but for I think there are some landed as well because this is also we are using the funds of the taxpayer Sophie to

425
00:57:16,65 --> 00:57:21,83
open to North America and so on so too.

426
00:57:22,06 --> 00:57:29,74
We didn't have it this way since these products and find solution for the constraints.

427
00:57:29,75 --> 00:57:37,51
Are totally out of question if you would have to describe your philosophy of life we would be. Going to you.

428
00:57:39,62 --> 00:57:46,33
And you met your future. Yeah. She loves the feel of life. I think for me.

429
00:57:49,76 --> 00:57:51,38
My motto personality is

430
00:57:51,38 --> 00:57:58,07
and I tell my daughter also I have one daughter who is going to be a scientist so she just joined the university in

431
00:57:58,07 --> 00:57:59,75
America. First you.

432
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:06,47
So I My motto is leave life was a purpose not just for yourself

433
00:58:06,47 --> 00:58:17,81
or to really it's to to contribute to changing lives for those people who are less fortunate than we are

434
00:58:17,81 --> 00:58:24,68
and I think there are millions of people who don't have the skills of the resources that we have.

435
00:58:24,7 --> 00:58:35,64
So it would be a tragedy for any human kind to leave for himself or herself like if I have a good life myself.

436
00:58:37,37 --> 00:58:44,24
Yes that is this like OK. So I think we have to you if we see the suffering of a fellow human being.

437
00:58:44,26 --> 00:58:55,74
We have to suffer together we have to feel the pain. And so. And I think if we have the means and invests the skills.

438
00:58:55,76 --> 00:59:00,67
We should do it. We should make use of it. So that.

439
00:59:00,68 --> 00:59:16,5
Again you see that showing is changing because our knowledge is spreading quicker than ever. Around the planet. Yeah.

440
00:59:16,52 --> 00:59:28,17
Yeah. Who is a science is making a difference a planet that appears to me. We want.

441
00:59:28,18 --> 00:59:30,89
That this question of oh I don't have.

442
00:59:32,7 --> 00:59:41,94
Yes sort of nonsense however I know that our lives have tremendously changed because of controversial science if you

443
00:59:43,03 --> 00:59:51,33
just. Back several decades back before the the invention of Fundy about ics.

444
00:59:51,8 --> 00:59:59,85
Before we had access to the first Sunday about it. Penicillin. We just accidentally disc.

445
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:00,39
A hundred from

446
01:00:00,39 --> 01:00:10,01
and more from a fungus that before that people were dying for a very simple truth ability is from infection.

447
01:00:11,23 --> 01:00:14,28
Infections.

448
01:00:14,3 --> 01:00:27,69
So that's not the kids anymore and so and then since the discovery of penicillin a lot of range of antibiotics

449
01:00:27,7 --> 01:00:34,43
and is discovered from microbes from plants from other sources. So yes.

450
01:00:34,53 --> 01:00:40,69
Science has made tremendous difference for for us. The vaccines.

451
01:00:41,54 --> 01:00:49,75
Polio is almost eradicate And so here and there are only vaccines. People are dying from a lot of prevent.

452
01:00:50,43 --> 01:00:57,47
Preventive does but that the tragedy if it is even to this day.

453
01:00:57,49 --> 01:01:03,44
Preventable diseases are still killing people in the developing world to do things a lot of dying from infection

454
01:01:03,44 --> 01:01:09,1
because they don't have access to simple on the about ticks or they don't say

455
01:01:09,1 --> 01:01:16,55
or didn't have them in sort of the knowledge that there actually is if they vaccinate the kids at certain ages they

456
01:01:16,55 --> 01:01:19,3
would have prevented so some.

457
01:01:20,25 --> 01:01:24,93
Diseases I at this day myself I don't know what I have been vaccinated I don't think I've been vaccinated

458
01:01:24,93 --> 01:01:26,57
when I was I was a kid.

459
01:01:27,79 --> 01:01:33,22
This is this is the world believes the haves and the have nots and that got so big a difference.

460
01:01:33,79 --> 01:01:39,26
But but yes science has made a tremendous tremendous difference in our lives.
