1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:08,33
What. Insects do for Africa and let's talk about food for a child. Yeah OK. So what or what.

2
00:00:08,4 --> 00:00:13,86
What can insects do for Africa for food. You know. So should I say I have no.

3
00:00:13,88 --> 00:00:20,45
Yeah OK I can just see if you are just I'll get ignored. Yeah OK.

4
00:00:20,47 --> 00:00:28,53
Inspectors can do a lot of things for a wide range of things for for Africa for Africa

5
00:00:28,53 --> 00:00:36,14
and we called it to go insects can do a wide range of things for Africa not just for Africa

6
00:00:36,15 --> 00:00:43,7
but for mankind on the planet that may give City dissing and important examples

7
00:00:43,71 --> 00:00:52,08
and one is pulling it that's pulling it that's like bees. Honeybees.

8
00:00:52,1 --> 00:01:01,3
While to be carpenter to be say a wide range of feel sick this play a critical role in food security.

9
00:01:01,32 --> 00:01:15,78
At least seventy to forty percent of our crops critical crops and and fruits and as it plants require pollination.

10
00:01:15,8 --> 00:01:23,82
So if these have to disappear tomorrow that. The. Food security situation. Globally would be very so shaky.

11
00:01:23,94 --> 00:01:35,05
This is one important old insects play for mankind the as a result I think is also insect is for food and feet.

12
00:01:36,27 --> 00:01:44,9
So about two billion people globally. Traditionally consume insects as a food source as a protein source.

13
00:01:46,21 --> 00:01:49,75
High quality protein source. And.

14
00:01:49,77 --> 00:01:59,32
So the insect insects also play a significant role in food chain in the food web chain.

15
00:02:00,00 --> 00:02:07,1
So tremendous number of amphibians. Birds. Chicken. Reptiles.

16
00:02:07,21 --> 00:02:15,62
They depend exclusively on insects for their fried so this is a tremendous contribution what insects do globally for

17
00:02:15,62 --> 00:02:24,83
animals humans and so on and about two thousand. Species of insects are consumed in one way or another.

18
00:02:26,03 --> 00:02:33,15
Globally out of that about a certain drove that consumed in Africa so.

19
00:02:33,17 --> 00:02:38,44
Central Africa southern parts of Africa is a hotspot for.

20
00:02:38,46 --> 00:02:39,8
Insects for food

21
00:02:39,8 --> 00:02:52,21
and feed so that's a second large impact what insects can do for us for humans a certain important been officially

22
00:02:52,21 --> 00:02:57,05
picked is that there are while there are how do you feel insects to humans

23
00:02:57,05 --> 00:03:02,63
and animals as vectors to diseases of transmission of diseases.

24
00:03:02,65 --> 00:03:10,22
Also a wide range of insects also play a critical role in our environment as pre-date there's predictors of.

25
00:03:11,81 --> 00:03:14,22
That that predators of as it harmful insects.

26
00:03:14,43 --> 00:03:19,71
There are insecticides if you don't most get those that transmitted diseases.

27
00:03:19,87 --> 00:03:30,39
There are a spider such feed on mosquitoes that there are predators that also feed all. Insects sat out.

28
00:03:30,98 --> 00:03:37,79
How do you feel to crops. So they plays that for you as a play significant only an hour or so. Well being.

29
00:03:38,97 --> 00:03:48,72
You say because we only started to begin to understand the meaning of insects. So.

30
00:03:48,74 --> 00:03:59,24
So I think more and more now people globally have begun understanding that all of insects particularly because of the.

31
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:07,66
What is called colony collapse syndrome or B.C. In North America and. In Europe.

32
00:04:07,84 --> 00:04:14,02
So more and more of the general public. Has Begun understanding this.

33
00:04:14,27 --> 00:04:19,75
So I would think that I think the next century will be really focused on insects

34
00:04:20,53 --> 00:04:25,75
and not only because of the role they play in agriculture the role they play in human

35
00:04:25,75 --> 00:04:29,93
and animal disease is a role they play in the food chain

36
00:04:30,74 --> 00:04:42,49
but also because of their associated impact on climate change as climate change becomes more and more evident.

37
00:04:42,5 --> 00:04:50,19
And temperatures rise. Begin to rise in Africa and in Europe. Indeed. Notice I made a car.

38
00:04:50,27 --> 00:04:55,98
What that will do is a shift also in their distribution of insects

39
00:04:55,98 --> 00:05:04,99
and disease transmitting insect is from the tropics to what used to be the temperate of September at climates

40
00:05:04,99 --> 00:05:14,01
and what happened. Saying is. Those diseases that are considered as. Poor. Monster diseases are tropical diseases.

41
00:05:14,64 --> 00:05:23,68
Neglected Diseases become relevant to the temperate climate. And so.

42
00:05:23,7 --> 00:05:32,36
At the end of the day I think then the planet has to address also this so-called neglected diseases that are

43
00:05:32,36 --> 00:05:40,04
transmitted by insects. So what you say is that knowledge scientific knowledge on insects is of the utmost importance.

44
00:05:41,43 --> 00:05:46,73
So scientific then that makes it is that scientific knowledge and more investment on science

45
00:05:46,73 --> 00:05:56,22
and technology dealing with insects because. Really a make it and break it. Situation for the well being of mankind.

46
00:05:57,58 --> 00:06:08,77
So I think they were led to have. To prepared now to focus and invest more on insects and related arthropods.

47
00:06:08,79 --> 00:06:19,38
And the role they play for the well being. Go to the. Mankind on the planet and and animals that we depend on.

48
00:06:20,95 --> 00:06:26,24
Their Institute actually is a sort of. Introduce fool offer here and treasures.

49
00:06:26,41 --> 00:06:36,05
Can you tell me a little bit about the kind of. Treasures you have in your wrist to sew for all this point of view and.

50
00:06:36,68 --> 00:06:43,04
The growing important a few sects and related arthropods for mankind.

51
00:06:43,62 --> 00:06:50,62
Mine is Station the International Center of insect physiology and ecology which is a unique center.

52
00:06:50,78 --> 00:06:53,29
That is exclusively focusing on.

53
00:06:53,95 --> 00:06:59,77
Insects and dealing with environmental hurdles and human health and animal hers

54
00:06:59,77 --> 00:07:08,06
and plan tells us the role it plays becomes even more critical for not just for Africa

55
00:07:08,06 --> 00:07:16,23
but for the rest of the world because we have a lot of threats because of our location in Africa because of our focus

56
00:07:16,23 --> 00:07:25,64
in Africa. We know how to deal with a myriad of insects and the diseases say they cause we know how to utilize.

57
00:07:25,66 --> 00:07:39,92
And number of. Beneficial insects. We have discovered and and created innovative voice of how to do loses.

58
00:07:40,29 --> 00:07:47,71
From natural products from what Africa has to offer based on also look at all knowledge

59
00:07:47,71 --> 00:07:59,88
and bringing science into the local knowledge. And saw. Also I think the diversity of Africa has a diversity of.

60
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:09,3
Plants the diversity of insects South Africa has the diversity of wildlife as our own we play for Africa

61
00:08:09,31 --> 00:08:14,48
and the rest of the planet would be. Would be. Critical.

62
00:08:14,97 --> 00:08:21,86
And very very important and so we were going to International Center of insect physiology and ecology.

63
00:08:23,16 --> 00:08:29,18
Would increasingly play a critical role. At the center of all of this.

64
00:08:29,2 --> 00:08:36,53
Could you uncover a few of those treasure few have in your institute what kind of.

65
00:08:36,54 --> 00:08:42,83
So let me give you an example on how.

66
00:08:45,01 --> 00:08:56,18
Is place a critical road for example says he flies are very very important place this. For livestock.

67
00:08:56,86 --> 00:09:08,57
And also also they transmitted diseases also to humans. Saw a large area large amount of areas of.

68
00:09:08,59 --> 00:09:19,39
In many countries in Africa. Are infested with says he flies making it not inhabitable. For animals and humans.

69
00:09:19,4 --> 00:09:26,18
But so many years ago scientists discovered of made a keen.

70
00:09:26,76 --> 00:09:31,23
And very important observation that some wildlife like zebras

71
00:09:32,09 --> 00:09:42,85
and like water barks they can live without being affected in heavily. Infested areas.

72
00:09:42,96 --> 00:09:48,04
This is a flame just day that's where cattle kind of set right where humans can sleep.

73
00:09:48,32 --> 00:09:52,92
And yet those areas are very important for Thailand.

74
00:09:53,08 --> 00:10:02,01
I've learned we can we can utilize so was a serious of experiments and research. Scientists discover the reason why.

75
00:10:02,57 --> 00:10:08,61
Zebras and some of these wildlife can live without any problem and says they fly areas.

76
00:10:08,99 --> 00:10:20,49
And that is because they emits they generate order from their bodies which is composed of chemicals natural came across

77
00:10:20,49 --> 00:10:23,58
other exuded from the bodies of the Sun months.

78
00:10:23,7 --> 00:10:34,19
So we have been characterized the chemical structure of the chemistry behind it and so on and now today.

79
00:10:34,2 --> 00:10:37,7
Fast forward we developed a color system.

80
00:10:39,83 --> 00:10:51,81
That emits chemicals that that are manufactured based on the chemical structure of the natural chemical that comes out

81
00:10:51,81 --> 00:10:59,71
of this wild animals and. We can protect the cattle. So a color system.

82
00:11:00,27 --> 00:11:04,87
That basically emits the same chemicals as wildlife.

83
00:11:05,11 --> 00:11:11,74
Those are there's one illustration where we can actually make use of the natural of nature

84
00:11:12,5 --> 00:11:20,19
and wildlife to solve the problem couldn't couldn't leave the critical problem.

85
00:11:20,48 --> 00:11:29,21
So there are many examples of like that that has disappeared has generated over the years. You also developed a.

86
00:11:29,23 --> 00:11:43,07
Quite ecological system of and hand seeing the harvest of for example mice or are such was my god. What did you do.

87
00:11:44,2 --> 00:11:47,24
So another example is also that.

88
00:11:47,25 --> 00:11:55,8
For example in crops basically in this step in the groups that are critical for food security like me is one of the

89
00:11:55,8 --> 00:12:03,89
major problem space but only in system borders. To control the same waters in a more.

90
00:12:04,44 --> 00:12:09,83
Ecology environmentally friendly way and affordable way for the farmers.

91
00:12:09,85 --> 00:12:15,09
Without spraying chemicals chemicals to control the pest.

92
00:12:15,11 --> 00:12:25,97
We developed a technology where to plant south naturally have chemicals to control to repel.

93
00:12:26,5 --> 00:12:29,31
The pests and to trap so pissed.

94
00:12:29,33 --> 00:12:35,7
When there are entire crop was mis or sort of them or as a cereals we can control the paste.

95
00:12:36,2 --> 00:12:47,42
This is very environmentally friendly. It is affordable. So you farmers can do it. It's also.

96
00:12:47,44 --> 00:12:54,61
It's also more sustainable. It's healthy for the environment. But while we're doing it.

97
00:12:54,68 --> 00:13:06,27
We made accidental discoveries this appellant plants truck plants also control a very very important parasitic weed

98
00:13:06,27 --> 00:13:14,58
called slag. So that was a huge huge discovery for us we were not working on strike.

99
00:13:16,07 --> 00:13:25,57
Or working on their own sticks but then we managed to. To control another extremely important food security parasite.

100
00:13:26,64 --> 00:13:33,04
But the beauty of this also is. It does several hours of things it. Improves soil fertility.

101
00:13:33,06 --> 00:13:42,38
Eight provides high quality feed for any months it improves over all the soil structure and fertility.

102
00:13:43,15 --> 00:13:49,48
And also in it increases productivity and recently we discovered last wish it did was it.

103
00:13:49,52 --> 00:13:52,6
This was this technology is a push pull technology.

104
00:13:53,11 --> 00:13:59,95
Maize plants actually become also healthier and they don't have a aflatoxin.

105
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:07,84
Which is a very bad his was a very bad toxin produce had by far the fungus a spurt of genius.

106
00:14:08,49 --> 00:14:16,08
And we managed to tackle a wide range of major consequence for African farmers

107
00:14:17,13 --> 00:14:25,92
and this normally can be adopted anywhere else in the planet for as little as it crops as well not just serious MS

108
00:14:25,92 --> 00:14:37,88
and sort of government as a staple crops. It sounds terrific. It sounds as a major improvement to the major technology.

109
00:14:37,9 --> 00:14:41,34
This is a major breakthrough some major breakthrough

110
00:14:42,7 --> 00:14:50,00
and I think what gives me pleasure is also this innovation discovery was made in Africa by African technical team.

111
00:14:50,61 --> 00:15:00,88
So this is also indications that actually we can generate Lucian's a very source first sustainable solution affordable

112
00:15:00,88 --> 00:15:06,68
solution for farmers that can be adopted and boost productivity and.

113
00:15:06,7 --> 00:15:14,19
Improve the whole environmental health as a whole this is exciting. This is absolutely exciting.

114
00:15:14,29 --> 00:15:26,48
What we need to do now is find relevant partners is to live on the Mount of fund to scale out this all across Africa

115
00:15:27,17 --> 00:15:32,46
because Sub-Saharan Africa has a major stem board a problem. Space problem.

116
00:15:32,76 --> 00:15:40,36
As a major aflatoxin problem major strike a problem. Major soil fertility problem.

117
00:15:41,52 --> 00:15:43,76
So was one technology you can sort of all of this.

118
00:15:44,34 --> 00:15:49,44
I can't think of any As a technology in recent years in agricultural sciences.

119
00:15:50,01 --> 00:15:59,26
And herds that can do all the seen in one very sustainable way environmentally friendly way. And uplift people.

120
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:07,3
Lives in a very short period of time in one season of adapting that technology you can already transform people's lives

121
00:16:07,3 --> 00:16:13,71
in one in one season cropping season and there is nothing that excites me more than months on these modes

122
00:16:13,71 --> 00:16:19,47
and translating that science and technology in product.

123
00:16:19,9 --> 00:16:24,08
And seeing the impact that I thought we would in one season on families and communities

124
00:16:24,08 --> 00:16:31,34
and it sounds as if you're in a hurry to introduce this very. Absolutely. In a hurry.

125
00:16:31,6 --> 00:16:35,93
So sometimes I drive people crazy. Because this technology.

126
00:16:36,54 --> 00:16:45,46
We know that it can transform people see lives in one season. It's needed all across Africa just like you started.

127
00:16:46,37 --> 00:16:47,82
So why can't we.

128
00:16:48,95 --> 00:16:52,48
The global community invest significant amount of money

129
00:16:52,48 --> 00:17:03,12
and effort to eradicate it uses technology eradicate the parasitic weed a strike which is literally Robin livelihoods

130
00:17:03,12 --> 00:17:07,34
after farmers and people. So we have and why.

131
00:17:07,39 --> 00:17:13,43
What makes me impatient and in a hurry because I know this technology can change lives

132
00:17:14,4 --> 00:17:18,08
and we cannot take it to the pharmacist fast enough.

133
00:17:19,23 --> 00:17:26,15
And plenty enough to make significant improvement in people's lives. That is one of the most frustrating.

134
00:17:26,61 --> 00:17:31,74
You can encounter but then I am determined to be as it was my team

135
00:17:32,59 --> 00:17:41,26
and partners to to reach many many many farmers with this up to now we have reached Only hundred ten thousand farmers

136
00:17:41,26 --> 00:17:44,52
in three countries and saying we can do a lot more than this.

137
00:17:46,12 --> 00:17:52,15
What kind of future do you see for Africa in terms of let's say from a trickle logical scientific point a few.

138
00:17:52,65 --> 00:17:59,8
The the future of Africa is very bright the future of Africa is very bright and wide.

139
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:12,2
I say that because we have a lot of resources we have natural resources. The gift of natural resources we have.

140
00:18:12,22 --> 00:18:21,07
The diversity of funny. We have diversity of plants we have a lot of natural resources like. Like minerals.

141
00:18:21,69 --> 00:18:33,99
And and as a value in materials. And I think in science so Africa is heaven for new discoveries waiting to happen.

142
00:18:34,6 --> 00:18:43,53
I think we can find solutions for many many of our constraints so the future is very bright

143
00:18:43,53 --> 00:18:51,78
but then Africa are fast to believe in itself has to believe in its people has to invest in its people.

144
00:18:51,92 --> 00:18:59,41
The most important and the most valuable resource for any country any country and to see its people.

145
00:19:00,5 --> 00:19:06,34
And I think on people who don't countries who don't invest in science and technology.

146
00:19:06,95 --> 00:19:14,14
Who don't invest in the education of people they are doomed to not to develop. So our future has to design.

147
00:19:14,15 --> 00:19:25,25
So in the next several also declared Africa is predicted to have. The youngest. Population on the planet.

148
00:19:25,27 --> 00:19:33,83
So this population there has to be utilised effectively. So if we do all that if we invest in science and technology.

149
00:19:34,32 --> 00:19:37,14
If we find solutions from what we have already.

150
00:19:37,67 --> 00:19:45,47
And if we believe in ourselves in our capacity the future of Africa is extremely bright and I think.

151
00:19:46,89 --> 00:19:53,12
It takes is it has been shown already that Africa in the last decade is on the rise and many of.

152
00:19:54,55 --> 00:19:59,78
The I thinks at least seven out of ten growing the economy started was enough.

153
00:20:00,24 --> 00:20:06,75
You know on the planet that is a lot of things we can do but I think the future is very very bright

154
00:20:08,02 --> 00:20:17,8
and in sexual play a large role in that there and so the future is bright and. Investment in science and technology.

155
00:20:17,82 --> 00:20:28,41
And the role also insights can play both in seed ensued in nutrition in House is also extremely bright and I think

156
00:20:29,13 --> 00:20:34,76
and a diversity of insects also within the continent is also among It is three years

157
00:20:35,69 --> 00:20:39,13
and has to use it has to Violet has to make use of it.

158
00:20:39,27 --> 00:20:40,9
Not only for the continent

159
00:20:40,9 --> 00:20:52,00

161
00:20:58,7 --> 00:21:01,02

162
00:21:01,19 --> 00:21:06,05
I believe Russia actually we are as more and more knowledge

163
00:21:06,06 --> 00:21:18,36
and awareness becomes available to the general public to say I think we are entering into a kid into a million in where

164
00:21:18,36 --> 00:21:21,32
insecticide.

165
00:21:21,34 --> 00:21:27,9
An important part of our well being and and boy is in danger

166
00:21:27,9 --> 00:21:37,26
and got its consumption main source of proteins for the animals but also for the humans but also I think they.

167
00:21:37,28 --> 00:21:50,46
Play also a critical role in their having a will sustainable environment and so there's certain that.

168
00:21:50,48 --> 00:21:59,95
Sex will play and will continue to play extremely cliff not only in mankind. So what role will go which was.

169

00:22:42,55 --> 00:22:49,38
And Africa is going to play a major role and Africa is going to play a significant role not only for itself.

175
00:22:49,77 --> 00:22:57,78
But for the rest of the planet. Africa is not going to be just a continent but receiving aid.

176
00:22:57,8 --> 00:23:04,78
