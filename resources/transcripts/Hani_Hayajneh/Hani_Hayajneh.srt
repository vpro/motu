1
00:00:00,41 --> 00:00:10,83
But I parked your curiosity for languages on a big you know

2
00:00:13,52 --> 00:00:23,13
when I think of the university in one thousand nine hundred eighty three I started studying out of mystic studies I

3
00:00:23,13 --> 00:00:27,96
attended courses in morphology syntax

4
00:00:27,96 --> 00:00:38,41
and I found out that most of the linguistic phenomena couldn't be explained by you know by the normal you know

5
00:00:38,41 --> 00:00:43,24
methodology which we follow in Arabic studies usually the tradition of extent this.

6
00:00:45,86 --> 00:00:50,62
In fact in the future after I got my B.A. and I had to stick at.

7
00:00:50,66 --> 00:00:59,43
There were if you're looking invest in one thousand and eighty seven. I attended master program in referee.

8
00:00:59,99 --> 00:01:14,72
Is the study of ancient inscriptions in general. Whether it's in size and rock or metal or on wood.

9
00:01:14,86 --> 00:01:27,08
There are many surfaces and we can talk about many surfaces were inscriptions written and in fact this is study.

10
00:01:27,15 --> 00:01:28,86
I mean studying it bigger.

11
00:01:28,89 --> 00:01:38,34
If you institute of archaeology and anthropology pave my way to understand more about the prehistory I mean I mean the.

12
00:01:39,27 --> 00:01:46,2
History of Arabic and of fact. In general and also gives me the opportunity discover more about.

13
00:01:47,64 --> 00:01:55,44
Because history of pins and I before Islam goes through the inscriptions we discover usually.

14
00:01:56,53 --> 00:01:59,93
Facts related to religious the.

15
00:02:00,17 --> 00:02:07,06
Religious beliefs and Abia as well as historical facts that are not listed in the Arabic sources

16
00:02:07,06 --> 00:02:08,21
or in the Arabic tradition.

17
00:02:11,21 --> 00:02:14,85
What I mean that studying Arabic and out of a culture

18
00:02:14,85 --> 00:02:27,09
and general would not yield to you know to useful conclusions without studying the ancient languages in general.

19
00:02:27,67 --> 00:02:29,67
I mean every students who attend.

20
00:02:29,79 --> 00:02:37,8
I mean who would like to study Arabic and maybe a culture should start you know maybe from the tenth century B.C.

21
00:02:37,8 --> 00:02:48,22
To have a wide understanding and understanding about the baby and peninsula and its history its religions

22
00:02:48,22 --> 00:02:49,52
and languages.

23
00:02:50,29 --> 00:03:04,05
If you started studying that was it you study was it like for you to first of all at one of us in fact my group in fact

24
00:03:04,05 --> 00:03:14,65
and nineteen thousand nine hundred eighty seven were the second group who attended which attended the bigger of the at

25
00:03:14,65 --> 00:03:23,98
the Institute of archaeology and anthropology and we are now more than thirty professors spread over Jordan and.

26
00:03:24,91 --> 00:03:25,67
Worldwide.

27
00:03:27,33 --> 00:03:41,28
And this gives us of course an impulse to work to work on further to discover our cultural heritage I mean our

28
00:03:41,35 --> 00:03:50,55
linguistic and cultural heritage in general. In fact. I'm OK I'm at the animal conversing Now when I started before.

29
00:03:51,45 --> 00:04:05,18
But my stay in Germany in fact I invested my stay in Germany to go. In this study and.

30
00:04:06,72 --> 00:04:09,39
I tried my best to through you know.

31
00:04:10,34 --> 00:04:24,23
Through German language discover more and more about the culture and the cultural history to live on live on time and.

32
00:04:24,97 --> 00:04:34,14
Also the Horn of Africa. And I'm also interested in that relationship between the Horn of Africa.

33
00:04:34,6 --> 00:04:47,17
In addition to historical spectrum. Covered by my study either through a period in Germany.

34
00:04:48,86 --> 00:04:55,23
And German period you discovered or you discover probably before

35
00:04:55,23 --> 00:05:00,85
but what I like what your German period which you describe is how you somehow through language learning the German

36
00:05:00,85 --> 00:05:08,64
language discovered more and more of the German soldiers Germany tortured you of course I mean OK the.

37
00:05:10,03 --> 00:05:16,00
I mean learning German was great importance for me it's the way forward to understand.

38
00:05:16,49 --> 00:05:21,7
Literature in written German in general and as you know German

39
00:05:21,7 --> 00:05:29,07
or any language it is a kind of a key it's a key to the culture itself.

40
00:05:29,97 --> 00:05:37,59
Not only to literature but also to the people I mean if you understand that I know if you can deal with the language.

41
00:05:38,74 --> 00:05:42,25
It means that you can discover the culture as well. You know.

42
00:05:43,00 --> 00:05:48,02
And German is of course a living language it's language it's been spoken by lots of people in Germany.

43
00:05:48,3 --> 00:05:59,99
You know you went to studying languages that are. Yes in fact. Well yes.

44
00:06:00,04 --> 00:06:08,44
If you if you know the system of a certain language then it will be easy for you to learn other languages.

45
00:06:09,23 --> 00:06:16,95
I mean I don't I talk now about you know grammar. I'm not talking about the script.

46
00:06:17,38 --> 00:06:17,71
You know

47
00:06:17,71 --> 00:06:28,81
and yes I had the background how to deal with languages in German that was for me that's why it was for me easy to

48
00:06:28,81 --> 00:06:36,66
learn German and also to deal with it and to write a lot of articles and publications in German.

49
00:06:38,01 --> 00:06:47,06
But when you say once you know how can you have easy access to the keys of languages and of inscriptions.

50
00:06:49,11 --> 00:06:50,39
But having those keys.

51
00:06:50,58 --> 00:06:58,1
You're generation is one of the first maybe that you really mean if I say generation I mean the generation Jordan.

52
00:06:58,27 --> 00:07:06,97
I mean but I mean Europeans. Look at about this under two hundred years ago since two hundred.

53
00:07:07,32 --> 00:07:19,68
I mean we are not the first in this field. You know studying ancient culture and I mean I've been in live and.

54
00:07:20,31 --> 00:07:26,56
I mean the European Union in this regard.

55
00:07:26,69 --> 00:07:39,37
Well of course and also they contributed inscriptions my generation which started abroad.

56
00:07:40,34 --> 00:07:50,8
The same with the same experience the same information. They gained. I mean the Europeans has again before.

57
00:07:51,07 --> 00:08:00,95
And of course I mean I mean on a daily. I mean there are you know. Inscriptions.

58
00:08:04,28 --> 00:08:09,45
Are discovered you know constantly and some of them are still undecided for it.

59
00:08:10,55 --> 00:08:18,01
But what we have of course I mean inscriptions and languages that we understand and we can deal with the ethics and.

60
00:08:19,66 --> 00:08:25,19
Conclude from the text either on the linguistic cultural or any other level.

61
00:08:25,65 --> 00:08:33,29
But I can imagine that such a beautiful thing that you discover through inscriptions through understanding languages

62
00:08:33,81 --> 00:08:43,41
that you're discovering for cultures the former. Yes in fact inscriptions are a repository of history.

63
00:08:44,25 --> 00:08:45,53
Of course if you decipher.

64
00:08:45,7 --> 00:08:52,02
I mean if you discover an inscription it means that you can understand a lot about the environment

65
00:08:53,04 --> 00:09:01,81
or the locality where the inscription is found in certain cases you can date the site

66
00:09:01,85 --> 00:09:03,89
and archaeological site through the inscription.

67
00:09:04,34 --> 00:09:12,44
I mean not only pottery but also other inscription and material can help us in dating archaeological sites

68
00:09:12,77 --> 00:09:20,91
and we have now I mean if you get if you if the inscription is dated for example then.

69
00:09:21,22 --> 00:09:26,98
Now you have fixed date of a certain site but sometimes your graph.

70
00:09:28,75 --> 00:09:40,04
I mean the way you write inscriptions also gives you indications about you know gives you up a little bit someone

71
00:09:40,04 --> 00:09:46,62
formation about they think about dating the site but not. Not an exact details. Yeah I mean.

72
00:09:46,65 --> 00:09:54,47
Also I mean if you discover an inscription which is a new and you are the first one who understand understand it

73
00:09:54,47 --> 00:09:59,81
and then you convey to the humanity and new experience in new information that.

74
00:10:02,76 --> 00:10:14,87
In my opinion of great importance to understand the human creativity and the and when you discover such a right

75
00:10:14,87 --> 00:10:16,63
when you decipher such an inscription

76
00:10:16,63 --> 00:10:25,58
and you know what does that do for it opens your window to it to do to a culture that was once here.

77
00:10:26,31 --> 00:10:33,95
You know of course I mean you understand. As soon as you discover and decipher inscription and understand it.

78
00:10:34,93 --> 00:10:46,12
Of course it opens a window to a lot of historical facts and. Cultural historical facts. About the region.

79
00:10:47,07 --> 00:10:55,08
It is this covered and when you say that you are generation is one of the first from Jordan yes.

80
00:11:00,03 --> 00:11:03,46
Yes Again what we're doing research on these interruptions and.

81
00:11:03,89 --> 00:11:11,23
What does that mean that you are the first from this region to do that. What a sense of well. In fact.

82
00:11:12,25 --> 00:11:20,35
It means a lot means that we have no generation from you know from Jordan I mean from the area from the region in

83
00:11:20,35 --> 00:11:28,95
general which can deal with its cultural heritage and understand it and the standard.

84
00:11:30,64 --> 00:11:36,56
You know and the same historical and do graphical context. You know if I talk about.

85
00:11:38,33 --> 00:11:44,42
OK I mean Europeans contributed in the fighting the inscriptions they contributed in

86
00:11:44,45 --> 00:11:46,01
and they were standing the inscriptions

87
00:11:46,2 --> 00:11:53,1
but sometimes some of them of course some of them a lack of the cultural background.

88
00:11:53,13 --> 00:11:58,99
You know I mean I have to say that frankly I mean some of them they like to the cultural background therefore I mean

89
00:11:59,34 --> 00:12:09,44
there and there is. Sending of the entire story is a little bit vague. You know but of course I mean now.

90
00:12:11,21 --> 00:12:16,72
In fact we are not working alone here we are working. Also with our European colleagues in Europe.

91
00:12:17,18 --> 00:12:20,39
Mainly in Europe and the United States and other countries.

92
00:12:20,89 --> 00:12:26,26
And we exchange of opinions about certain issues in this regard

93
00:12:26,26 --> 00:12:35,67
and after that we reach a conclusion in which you bring in some extra Yes layer because very importantly because you

94
00:12:35,67 --> 00:12:38,17
are from from from the same region.

95
00:12:39,12 --> 00:12:49,84
Yes but I don't I have to say that my European colleagues also help in different and different perspectives.

96
00:12:50,92 --> 00:12:57,68
I mean we conduct joint surveys we conduct also joint studies together.

97
00:12:58,19 --> 00:13:03,94
And I think it's important not sort of from the center of a perspective but also from the cultural perspective.

98
00:13:04,87 --> 00:13:12,76
Because it's important to get in contact with our European colleagues and I mean not only Europeans

99
00:13:12,76 --> 00:13:24,54
but outside Jordan I mean our colleagues from outside Jordan to have exchanges which means that we can do more for

100
00:13:24,54 --> 00:13:28,41
cultural and that is standing as well. If it where you say that your.

101
00:13:28,55 --> 00:13:36,93
As you were born here your race you are part of this culture and you are one of the first. Working.

102
00:13:37,14 --> 00:13:38,14
If you don't understand.

103
00:13:40,94 --> 00:13:49,24
That makes you can imagine it's that's a very special role you have very important probably very special.

104
00:13:49,54 --> 00:13:58,98
Yes I can't I personally can't evaluate myself and whether I am that I have a special role or not it's the academic.

105
00:14:01,68 --> 00:14:09,05
Again they're called to decide this you know I mean I'm not the one who decides that because I can't do is you shed

106
00:14:09,05 --> 00:14:19,59
light all the time. That people here. Before you know much about you know just again this is true and this is true in.

107
00:14:20,92 --> 00:14:29,82
I mean some generations. I mean. What I want to say that.

108
00:14:32,1 --> 00:14:42,97
To be broad broad minded and accept the opening of others is of a Great is a crucial to understand and to exchange.

109
00:14:45,17 --> 00:14:54,41
Exchange ideas and also to reach reliable conclusions. I think that who was who would like to study this.

110
00:14:55,54 --> 00:15:03,52
Culture in general should have a broad knowledge about a lot of things you know not only history not only languages

111
00:15:03,52 --> 00:15:12,54
but also ancient history and also more than. Modern history and ancient cultures and modern culture.

112
00:15:12,91 --> 00:15:17,5
I mean they are not separated you cannot separate them because I mean.

113
00:15:20,51 --> 00:15:28,18
Who lived in this area for a long time I think I mean they exist there existed after that I mean what I'm talking about

114
00:15:28,72 --> 00:15:34,94
is the change of political entities in but the people are the same the people are the same and they also.

115
00:15:37,94 --> 00:15:47,35
You know continue to live in this in this area in this region and I think we have to take into consideration.

116
00:15:49,53 --> 00:16:02,32
I mean a lot of perspectives to towards studying a certain topic on certain subjects in our cultural history. It is.

117
00:16:02,58 --> 00:16:13,46
I mean I mean studying the past is connected with that with our living our living had it it. We cannot separate them.

118
00:16:14,31 --> 00:16:23,84
But the fact that you shed light on times that that before people wouldn't know much about because it was not you know

119
00:16:26,76 --> 00:16:37,59
what where why why is that why is it that you are one of the first to do just that I have some colleagues who are older

120
00:16:37,59 --> 00:16:40,19
than me and did that. Of course but.

121
00:16:43,67 --> 00:16:51,59
I think it's important to have a generation who you know interested in its cultural heritage and cultural history

122
00:16:54,47 --> 00:17:01,16
and you what I want to say is you by by being one of the first Jordanian professor now

123
00:17:01,16 --> 00:17:07,2
but the one of the scientists researching investigating inscriptions and languages

124
00:17:07,2 --> 00:17:15,31
and shedding light all the time that somehow is not known about water. Why is it that times.

125
00:17:15,77 --> 00:17:22,98
What makes it that those times were not to see him or not accepted or not embraced by before.

126
00:17:23,57 --> 00:17:40,84
Yes because you know I mean if I think that I've been I mean as an example for example that TRUTH ABOUT THAT I CAN they

127
00:17:40,84 --> 00:17:44,08
were concerned with the bins and its history.

128
00:17:45,02 --> 00:17:54,98
They didn't get in fact the axes to enchant sources because at that time they couldn't they hadn't the instruments.

129
00:17:55,53 --> 00:18:03,16
That you know give them the axis for example to ancient South Arabia. Not that I've been to. Or.

130
00:18:05,64 --> 00:18:17,5
I mean we are talking about two hundred years all discipline. I mean not not that of that ancient let all. Yeah.

131
00:18:17,75 --> 00:18:31,28
And we can expect that such a big source is not covered mean they're covered maybe two hundred years before Islam for

132
00:18:31,28 --> 00:18:36,62
example but they don't go deeper into history because the composer

133
00:18:36,62 --> 00:18:47,5
and the authors didn't have access to such to such an approach because source. So that's why it's important to.

134
00:18:48,48 --> 00:18:58,00
They're going to consideration of the archaeological sources because sources as well as. Maybe oral history as well.

135
00:18:58,00 --> 00:19:06,59
It's also important in oral history it's important to understand ancient cultures because the same people are still

136
00:19:06,59 --> 00:19:15,88
living in the same people who you know established ancient cultures I mean their descendants are still still very you

137
00:19:15,88 --> 00:19:15,89
know

138
00:19:15,89 --> 00:19:30,00
and that's why I feel it's important to study in a holistic approach where we can take into consideration because African

139
00:19:30,00 --> 00:19:35,21
sources the archaeology and also to living heritage but

140
00:19:35,21 --> 00:19:48,09
when you say like the like before the ancient cultures were not really part of the storytelling of their rhetoric

141
00:19:48,09 --> 00:19:56,17
history. It's That's now changing and I suspect because you bring them the stories of those days.

142
00:19:56,47 --> 00:20:05,14
Yes this is now we have. New Window to ancient history of the arrogant Peninsula.

143
00:20:05,17 --> 00:20:05,86
This is a new

144
00:20:05,86 --> 00:20:14,46
and this new window was not possible to open without studying you know finding inscriptions of this happening the

145
00:20:14,46 --> 00:20:18,03
ancient ancient Arabian and semantic inscriptions in general

146
00:20:19,21 --> 00:20:26,55
and what does this this window because I suppose much of the students you get they are taught in a way that they don't

147
00:20:26,55 --> 00:20:36,55
understand our styles before you know how did you. How do they. That area that era when they come in your your faculty.

148
00:20:37,6 --> 00:20:39,00
Yeah that's a good question.

149
00:20:39,02 --> 00:20:49,44
In fact the students who come to our faculty they have their own you know ideas about at Abia

150
00:20:49,44 --> 00:20:51,49
or about the symmetry cultures in general.

151
00:20:52,00 --> 00:20:59,19
But when they get to the plea involved in this field they start they start changing their their understanding

152
00:20:59,19 --> 00:21:06,01
and also their methodology towards the studying. The cultural history of the semantic world.

153
00:21:06,66 --> 00:21:09,13
But what is their view when they call me.

154
00:21:09,19 --> 00:21:13,23
Well how do you how do they see that when they don't have to it's not it's a kind of economic times

155
00:21:13,23 --> 00:21:24,22
and in fact most of our students who are coming to in fact. They are selected you know because they know I mean.

156
00:21:24,71 --> 00:21:27,92
They know in prayer. What are they going to do you know.

157
00:21:28,35 --> 00:21:33,8
And then because they have a little bit you know a little knowledge about this

158
00:21:33,8 --> 00:21:43,93
and about the cultural history of Arabia and this in the quad in general. But at the institute.

159
00:21:44,22 --> 00:21:52,32
We train them and we conduct surveys so that they understand what we are doing in a better way.

160
00:21:52,45 --> 00:21:59,72
But what is the because I suppose the view that they have nor are the people from Jordan and from the Arabian.

161
00:22:00,68 --> 00:22:03,55
What how do they see in general the times before.

162
00:22:06,23 --> 00:22:22,73
Well in fact of flourishing they had a flourishing civilization and Arabian for Islam and word ignorance period.

163
00:22:22,97 --> 00:22:32,18
I think it's not the right word to use in this context because you know ignorance it means that the people who were

164
00:22:32,18 --> 00:22:39,76
living there were ignorant and. They were not in contact with civilization is certain about this is in fact.

165
00:22:40,73 --> 00:22:52,35
A little bit you know it's I mean the idea should be defined a little bit in fact Arabia witnessed flourishing culture.

166
00:22:52,7 --> 00:22:55,4
I mean economy.

167
00:22:57,46 --> 00:22:59,9
Historically and culturally in general

168
00:23:00,41 --> 00:23:09,75
and it's our role now to present this culture which is which was hidden in the inscriptions that you're all. Present.

169
00:23:11,11 --> 00:23:20,65
I mean to present to present the contents of this ancient heritage to be absorbed by the young generation because it's

170
00:23:20,65 --> 00:23:25,67
part of their identity. It's part of their history and I think it's our role now to.

171
00:23:26,83 --> 00:23:37,49
To make them aware that Arabia is not you know I mean I mean maybe generally yet in terms of religious of religious

172
00:23:37,49 --> 00:23:44,43
perspective but from the civilized perspective I think specially the south and parts

173
00:23:44,43 --> 00:23:59,82
and the central parts of great importance and significance for to understand. I mean the OK and what's not.

174
00:24:00,54 --> 00:24:02,13
I think the sources.

175
00:24:02,17 --> 00:24:10,01
Give us a new glimpse I mean the ancient source is there in an instant inscriptions that give us a new glimpses on the

176
00:24:11,3 --> 00:24:21,51
hidden history and the hidden. Culture of Arabia before Islam. And this is you know now evident I mean.

177
00:24:23,66 --> 00:24:33,95
Even through research and through archaeological surveys and through also started studies published. You know.

178
00:24:35,47 --> 00:24:41,44
I mean I mean we have thousands of publications in this regard.

179
00:24:41,73 --> 00:24:47,5
But most of them in fact are written in foreign languages that's why they are not accessible by the people

180
00:24:48,44 --> 00:24:51,95
and it's I want to roll now to I mean not to translate.

181
00:24:53,9 --> 00:25:06,11
This huge literature but also to present to present the cultural history of every viewer in Arabic.

182
00:25:06,68 --> 00:25:13,65
This is I think this is important. So that people can have access to the source.

183
00:25:14,92 --> 00:25:23,31
And when you have you studied several languages you let You can lay connections.

184
00:25:24,34 --> 00:25:36,83
So you create worlds that had been here now before I was not understood by people I mean you mean there's clearly both

185
00:25:36,87 --> 00:25:44,8
if you're sick you're you're putting a light on times that that for most people was not known yet.

186
00:25:47,14 --> 00:25:55,7
So people understand now that for example you better. This is the culture of what it stands for.

187
00:25:57,02 --> 00:26:03,97
Yes of course about I have to say that I'm not the first one of the. No of course I know but you know understanding.

188
00:26:06,29 --> 00:26:09,09
I mean if you talk about big or a few

189
00:26:09,09 --> 00:26:13,85
or the ancient languages yes of course as I said in the beginning there are in fact.

190
00:26:14,53 --> 00:26:23,47
The key to cultures and Betty and inscriptions are written in about the end language in about the end script

191
00:26:24,08 --> 00:26:30,12
and if you decide for the script then you understand the language and you understand after that the contents of.

192
00:26:31,05 --> 00:26:41,6
Over certain inscription and from this inscription you can extract and grow conclusions regarding. Religious history.

193
00:26:41,65 --> 00:26:47,92
Regarding commercial issues regarding. Social relations among people at that time.

194
00:26:50,16 --> 00:26:54,32
I mean through this knowledge and you can nurtured the.

195
00:26:57,03 --> 00:27:07,26
You know the history of this region of course it is it's do you see that also that there are connections between the

196
00:27:07,26 --> 00:27:08,59
pre-reading worlds

197
00:27:08,59 --> 00:27:17,98
and Arab world that somehow I mean like do you see connections that before had not been seen between the previous let

198
00:27:17,98 --> 00:27:28,07
me grow old you know because of course yes yes of course because people you know continue to exist in every view

199
00:27:28,46 --> 00:27:40,02
and of course the. Good with them you know and traditions that continued until nowadays. Do you have examples of that.

200
00:27:41,19 --> 00:27:45,45
Well let's say something some ancient South

201
00:27:45,45 --> 00:27:54,58
and maybe in inscriptions from Yemen from Grant from presenteeism And in fact we rely on human idea.

202
00:27:54,78 --> 00:28:02,25
It's to understand ancient inscriptions. Because some words that the king. Not in ancient South Arabian inscriptions.

203
00:28:02,71 --> 00:28:12,95
They are still used in Yemen. You know I mean. And this is this is a fact you know. And also some rituals that existed.

204
00:28:13,4 --> 00:28:20,18
I mean that we know from the inscriptions still exist and existing until nowadays you know in human.

205
00:28:21,11 --> 00:28:31,13
And which means that this culture continued to exists a part of political change is a part of economics changes

206
00:28:31,13 --> 00:28:36,87
but people have preserved the skill shot and edited. And continue to transmit it.

207
00:28:39,58 --> 00:28:46,86
It's a gamble bureau or certain other. Oh it's something different. It's something the surface.

208
00:28:48,19 --> 00:28:57,32
One and something different. I mean the coming burial inscriptions. OK it's from. But OK I mean.

209
00:28:57,88 --> 00:29:06,99
This is an evidence about the resurrection. And the people in Arabia used to bury their camels with them.

210
00:29:07,17 --> 00:29:19,21
So that they can rest. OK. Where this obsession for languages and inscriptions started.

211
00:29:19,27 --> 00:29:28,65
Well in fact this passion started after my being in fact doing my be a study in Jordan at Yarmouk universities

212
00:29:28,65 --> 00:29:37,78
and see I'm looking versity I tried my best to understand the culture in a more deep and with a more depth

213
00:29:37,78 --> 00:29:48,29
but I didn't find my you know. I didn't find this in doing might be a start. Is as you know.

214
00:29:48,77 --> 00:29:50,12
Because we were studying Arabic

215
00:29:50,12 --> 00:29:59,9
and stick in general in the traditional way studying the languages in a sing I mean not in the UK.

216
00:30:01,3 --> 00:30:02,89
Way but in synchronic way.

217
00:30:05,1 --> 00:30:16,16
Well I started looking for programs that you know that could help me in decipher the ancient history of Arabic in

218
00:30:16,16 --> 00:30:26,06
general and the ancient history of Arabian culture and that was after nineteen eighty seven

219
00:30:26,06 --> 00:30:32,5
when I attended a master program at the Institute of archaeology and anthropology.

220
00:30:32,93 --> 00:30:40,05
Where I started and I finished my degree of theme.

221
00:30:40,43 --> 00:30:49,28
And my master's thesis was concerned with the relationship with the relationship between big and you're going to tick.

222
00:30:49,98 --> 00:30:59,28
Are you going to think is one of the Bronze Age Late Bronze Age languages that existed on the Mediterranean Sea and.

223
00:31:01,13 --> 00:31:10,13
I tried to find the lexical affinities between we call them some scholars call the classical Arabic or.

224
00:31:11,17 --> 00:31:18,77
Standard and of a lot of different terminology. I mean here the Arabic of course and the pretty Islamic and A.B.

225
00:31:18,77 --> 00:31:19,42
and Poetry.

226
00:31:20,55 --> 00:31:34,22
And I found out that there are a lot of aspects that you know constitute the kind of Sickle similarity between you

227
00:31:34,22 --> 00:31:41,91
going to take and and I back. And yes because this could be of course explain because both languages.

228
00:31:43,24 --> 00:31:45,79
They have the same mother language which we call it.

229
00:31:46,04 --> 00:31:53,92
It's a hypothetical language we call it brought a semantic and this looks talk could be you know from this.

230
00:31:55,85 --> 00:31:59,99
From this genetic relationship. But it could be.

231
00:32:00,08 --> 00:32:13,35
Also I mean this relationship could be also through historical historical factors when I mean by. Migrations by.

232
00:32:14,92 --> 00:32:23,66
You know historical contacts commercial contacts etc But I mean that we have a lot of historical models to explain this

233
00:32:23,7 --> 00:32:31,22
similarity. But in general I mean most of the languages in live and the Levant and Arabia.

234
00:32:31,42 --> 00:32:34,36
And also in misery theme in there are interconnected

235
00:32:34,77 --> 00:32:41,48
and we call them Sister languages because they come from the same from the same origin or origin.

236
00:32:41,51 --> 00:32:50,73
We call it similar proto symmetry and I wanted to record what is your fashion nation your photos of languages.

237
00:32:51,41 --> 00:32:56,75
Yes because I found in general I found the languages.

238
00:32:57,45 --> 00:33:02,46
I mean studying the language to provide us with them the right instruments to decipher cultures.

239
00:33:04,15 --> 00:33:11,14
For example I did forty five years ancient If you pick all if you pick language because my professor

240
00:33:11,14 --> 00:33:16,51
and Bellina Professor Reiner folk too as I mean you said you know and professor in this field.

241
00:33:16,98 --> 00:33:22,98
And I did with him five years studying you know engine if you if you pick

242
00:33:23,79 --> 00:33:29,99
and why because I wanted to understand the relationship between Arabia and the Horn of Africa.

243
00:33:30,55 --> 00:33:37,06
I mean you know studying the language you know would explain a lot of historical facts and.

244
00:33:38,22 --> 00:33:44,48
Circle phenomena in terms of relationship between Arabia and the Horn of Africa is an example

245
00:33:45,68 --> 00:33:57,7
and as I said to you because I was interested in exploring the history of Arabic language and the Arabic culture

246
00:33:57,7 --> 00:33:59,98
and Dylan in general. Where did it.

247
00:34:00,7 --> 00:34:07,62
Even before your studies where did this fascination for languages and for for for just read

248
00:34:07,62 --> 00:34:10,81
but it really just was in fact in general I was interested in languages.

249
00:34:11,23 --> 00:34:14,54
Even during my childhood

250
00:34:14,58 --> 00:34:25,96
and that's why I was interested in English from the beginning although I was studying Arabic and.

251
00:34:27,57 --> 00:34:33,75
Because I found I found out that studying certain language would open and pave the way for.

252
00:34:34,03 --> 00:34:42,38
For me to get information about certain. About certain aspects of our cultural history.

253
00:34:43,84 --> 00:34:53,85
I mean from the beginning I was interested in languages but I can see how this. How this world at the beginning.

254
00:34:54,81 --> 00:35:02,54
I mean. You know. But when you were really young. I mean when you were ten or eleven What how did how did it.

255
00:35:02,59 --> 00:35:17,21
How did it show. What. What was a fascination. First a nation and languages. I can't remember.

256
00:35:17,45 --> 00:35:20,42
I mean I can't make it since this is

257
00:35:20,42 --> 00:35:26,62
and this regard your book did you want to discover the world to understand the world with did you just want to be usual

258
00:35:26,62 --> 00:35:38,91
Veron or. I don't know I can say that you know we had no internet at that time T.V.

259
00:35:38,91 --> 00:35:42,15
Also was not accessible at that time because I am.

260
00:35:42,76 --> 00:35:50,9
I was born in a village where electricity didn't exist at that time one thousand eight hundred two.

261
00:35:51,05 --> 00:36:02,12
And you know we had and that was the. Window to the world you know.

262
00:36:02,42 --> 00:36:12,31
And of course I hear a lot of languages and the radio. I mean. I found out later that this is German.

263
00:36:12,61 --> 00:36:20,13
This is French you know and that I couldn't you know differentiate between German French or Dutch or Swedish

264
00:36:20,13 --> 00:36:25,78
or Russian but you know this. I mean when I started to hear.

265
00:36:26,61 --> 00:36:29,28
I mean there were voices only voices you know for me and

266
00:36:29,28 --> 00:36:36,86
but there are certain points where the pronoun pronunciation is different from. Different different.

267
00:36:36,9 --> 00:36:38,11
I mean different from each other.

268
00:36:38,37 --> 00:36:49,41
And maybe this is one of the one of the reasons why I was interested I mean I mean I was interested in languages

269
00:36:49,41 --> 00:36:51,75
because how did you listen and you were like.

270
00:36:52,64 --> 00:37:00,21
Suppose in the living room where how did you know that you could find different languages. You know I can't.

271
00:37:00,26 --> 00:37:11,01
It wasn't in the living room of course I mean I don't understand your question how do you know it's a radio you know

272
00:37:11,01 --> 00:37:16,8
you you go you you hear those language you how did you do that where you just scrolling through the channels for us

273
00:37:16,8 --> 00:37:24,8
and scrolling through just channels and trying to even even within the out of it was fair. You know and I tried to.

274
00:37:25,83 --> 00:37:32,12
You know we have many Derrick's here and I don't and it was for me at the beginning difficult to understand.

275
00:37:32,71 --> 00:37:36,53
For example of the moral conduct and this is one.

276
00:37:37,58 --> 00:37:52,7
This is one example of why I have the right instruments to study languages because it's also there could be considered

277
00:37:52,7 --> 00:37:59,74
as languages because sometimes they have different morphology and different syntax and this made me also.

278
00:38:01,28 --> 00:38:05,93
Yes Dick to the person who's studying languages in fact I can't.

279
00:38:06,34 --> 00:38:10,32
If I factor is why I was interested in languages from the beginning.

280
00:38:12,93 --> 00:38:16,28
I don't know I have no president since this is about this.

281
00:38:18,26 --> 00:38:27,9
You are from of you're from a family that it's also a scientific interest or. Yes In fact in my family.

282
00:38:30,22 --> 00:38:35,62
In fact they were interested. I mean my father is a businessman and.

283
00:38:36,82 --> 00:38:47,17
My family in general used to and money through business and it was my uncle in fact my elder uncle who supported me

284
00:38:47,17 --> 00:38:47,61
and.

285
00:38:48,33 --> 00:38:57,61
You know opened my academic world because he is considered one of the first to graduate from the Jordan University.

286
00:38:58,84 --> 00:39:05,65
And you fact he supported my career in my studies

287
00:39:05,65 --> 00:39:15,5
and also opened my eyes towards you know towards the world because he got in contact with the people in our man

288
00:39:15,5 --> 00:39:20,18
and the capital city and also worldwide. That's why he wanted me to.

289
00:39:21,06 --> 00:39:31,4
You know to deviate from the carrier of my family you know and it did it. And when you described your. Well.

290
00:39:34,47 --> 00:39:40,44
What sparked your curiosity. Well. Regarding languages.

291
00:39:43,47 --> 00:39:51,08
Well in fact I am a patient guy and I have to say I am very very patient in even from a child.

292
00:39:52,08 --> 00:40:00,55
I used to help my father in his store and in his business since I was seven years old. In fact I have to. That.

293
00:40:00,99 --> 00:40:09,78
And this caused you know this part of my life shaped my life and. To be a serious person.

294
00:40:10,31 --> 00:40:20,11
And because I didn't in fact I didn't enjoy most of the children my age enjoyed before you know and.

295
00:40:21,96 --> 00:40:24,94
My father wanted me to be OK. The biz the monk the.

296
00:40:25,93 --> 00:40:35,72
And the village and he sent me first to Roman Catholic school that wasn't one nine hundred seventy

297
00:40:35,72 --> 00:40:45,23
and the story of my get them applying for my. Is and my you know my school life started them.

298
00:40:45,7 --> 00:40:50,1
But it due to the problems that occurred in in Jordan at that time.

299
00:40:50,5 --> 00:40:55,00
My father preferred that I come back to the village and study them.

300
00:40:55,4 --> 00:41:00,19
And continue the studying They're doing my preparatory my elementary preparatory

301
00:41:00,19 --> 00:41:09,57
and secondary schooling I did it in the village in fact even in a village in nearby.

302
00:41:10,34 --> 00:41:20,17
And they used to walk from my house to their village for three kilometers sometimes. And maybe this. Any This walk.

303
00:41:21,68 --> 00:41:26,26
You know stimulated me to think about the world

304
00:41:26,26 --> 00:41:31,84
and about sometimes the creation about lot of things you know usually I mean usually.

305
00:41:32,75 --> 00:41:41,3
School boys think sometimes some of them they don't think I think about it because they have other interests. And.

306
00:41:42,66 --> 00:41:53,02
In fact even even this influenced my life in my future life in the university even in Germany and also later I can see.

307
00:41:53,86 --> 00:42:02,18
I can see. During the element preparatory and elementary. Period pieces.

308
00:42:03,13 --> 00:42:10,06
I used to study Arabic poetry ancient Arabic poetry. And I was fascinated in fact.

309
00:42:11,23 --> 00:42:19,65
With the contents of the Arabic poetry and how they can be recited and ethnic mix time.

310
00:42:20,82 --> 00:42:26,98
And but I was interested also to understand the words integrate and used in this.

311
00:42:29,1 --> 00:42:31,01
Such passages political passages

312
00:42:31,4 --> 00:42:39,55
and I can assure you of that later I found out that our teacher sometimes they explained in a traditional ways

313
00:42:39,72 --> 00:42:41,91
explained some words in a traditional way.

314
00:42:42,33 --> 00:42:47,9
But I was not convinced you know I was not convinced mostly in their explanations

315
00:42:48,73 --> 00:42:58,48
and I kept this until I went to the university in one thousand eight hundred three where I attended the Arabic program.

316
00:42:59,37 --> 00:43:08,52
University and we went in fact with assistance of professors of Arabic studies we went in depth to study

317
00:43:08,66 --> 00:43:20,22
and studying the ancient poetry but I mean. The problem. I didn't find a solution for my problem.

318
00:43:20,44 --> 00:43:21,98
I mean how to understand.

319
00:43:22,52 --> 00:43:30,19
The Arabic poetry in a proper way and how what are the origins of some certain words and this.

320
00:43:31,04 --> 00:43:37,76
And this Arabic poetry and also I mean to explain how linguistic phenomena.

321
00:43:38,28 --> 00:43:50,79
Could be you know how could we explain linguistic phenomena and in Arabic and particularly in within this wide context.

322
00:43:50,93 --> 00:43:55,03
I mean within this wide Arab country Arabic context were Arabic is used.

323
00:43:55,07 --> 00:44:03,37
You know as you know Arabic is use in different parts of the world. In fact that was not enough for me because I.

324
00:44:04,13 --> 00:44:14,7
You know I started to excavate and to dig for the origins of Arabic and I found my I found some of the answer.

325
00:44:15,17 --> 00:44:19,22
During my studies. My misters where we exposed to.

326
00:44:20,22 --> 00:44:26,91
In fact I have so European experience I was taught by different European professors

327
00:44:26,91 --> 00:44:33,6
and American professors at the Institute of archaeology and anthropology at that time we were exposed to.

328
00:44:35,19 --> 00:44:45,52
And also I mean we attended courses to study for example can I to ancient South Arabian if you pick.

329
00:44:47,72 --> 00:44:52,42
Certain And there are all of those language of these languages are sister languages

330
00:44:52,91 --> 00:45:02,58
and to go back to one to one source or to one origin which we called proto Semitic now. Well.

331
00:45:04,1 --> 00:45:16,00
Well this in fact open paved the way for my future research and since then I was interested in studying get more

332
00:45:16,00 --> 00:45:32,31
and more more languages to understand and its context in a proper way but what makes that. Now you unique in the world.

333
00:45:34,11 --> 00:45:38,22
It makes you know why I'm afraid of this world unique.

334
00:45:39,45 --> 00:45:50,25
Yeah well I'm trying to connect and to find the relationship between Arabic and its cultural and linguistic. Context.

335
00:45:50,88 --> 00:45:58,69
This is this is what I'm trying to show to. My not only to my colleagues or to my.

336
00:46:00,65 --> 00:46:14,24
Students and also to make it known abroad this. I mean this methodology was was not known in fact in the Arab world.

337
00:46:14,75 --> 00:46:26,34
I mean how to connect on a big with its surrounding languages through ages and also the culture where Arabic managed.

338
00:46:26,69 --> 00:46:38,75
Yeah. Well this influence of course my future studies and future research I did my I did my M.

339
00:46:38,75 --> 00:46:46,25
A thesis on the relationship between Arabic and you've got to take it because because an important source.

340
00:46:47,04 --> 00:46:56,34
Because it's a language with existed and continue it exists and the Levant also and of course and North Africa.

341
00:46:57,55 --> 00:47:02,12
Here we hear and then you know.

342
00:47:02,79 --> 00:47:14,8
And then alas I mean as you know and we have like prayers five prayers this is the we call it

343
00:47:14,8 --> 00:47:22,2
and then I'll ask that which comes after afternoon. You said a certain moment in your when you were young.

344
00:47:22,7 --> 00:47:26,44
Listen listen to this Arabic poetry. And.

345
00:47:27,5 --> 00:47:34,45
Read sort of short In fact it was included in the curriculum the school year

346
00:47:34,97 --> 00:47:43,54
and also I hear that you know some people improvise that you know and I was interested in understanding the meaning.

347
00:47:45,16 --> 00:47:51,26
Of this point three in a proper way but you know huge We usually people resigned this poetry

348
00:47:51,26 --> 00:47:56,19
but they sometimes don't understand because her background of this point three

349
00:47:56,61 --> 00:47:59,99
and I was interested in the cultural background not only on the high.

350
00:48:00,19 --> 00:48:01,89
To be recited it's beautiful

351
00:48:03,12 --> 00:48:12,7
but I want to understand interested in understand the standing the cultural dimensions of this poetry

352
00:48:13,03 --> 00:48:22,65
and its language to you Mr in the. Sight of you know this is this is what I missed in fact during my school period.

353
00:48:22,82 --> 00:48:26,22
Also I can see even during my me a period

354
00:48:26,22 --> 00:48:35,54
and at the university because they used to teach us in a traditional way you know trying to explain it couldn't you

355
00:48:35,54 --> 00:48:45,73
know you know explain the cultural background of this poetry and not only the cultural backgrounds but also.

356
00:48:46,96 --> 00:48:55,86
The contained items that were for me very difficult to understand as as anger.

357
00:48:56,09 --> 00:49:06,09
You know because maybe in poetry represents the Arabic where to represents a very old stage of the Arabic literature

358
00:49:07,11 --> 00:49:14,48
and and it was I don't I can't I can't say that it was disconnected from the people

359
00:49:14,84 --> 00:49:20,39
but it was represented a certain cultural phase and Arabian Peninsula

360
00:49:20,94 --> 00:49:30,94
and I was you know in future stages of my life I was interested in to understand the cultural background

361
00:49:30,94 --> 00:49:33,42
and the cultural context of this poetry

362
00:49:33,92 --> 00:49:44,55
and also the beginning slam I mean the language of Koran was also for me a very difficult language to understand I

363
00:49:44,55 --> 00:49:48,79
think and I think we can should some light on the core

364
00:49:48,79 --> 00:49:57,78
and acting from different languages that existed in Arabia before Islam because some words they continued to be used.

365
00:49:59,18 --> 00:49:59,99
Continue to be.

366
00:50:02,04 --> 00:50:12,82
At the time and also they were part of the quote an activist and I was interested in and understanding such words

367
00:50:12,82 --> 00:50:21,37
and and I have some research on this regard. They have. I started the project on this regard.

368
00:50:21,67 --> 00:50:29,21
Can you do you remember the poem the first poem that makes you. Well then in fact.

369
00:50:29,46 --> 00:50:36,73
I'm interested in the breeze let me get a B. and Put it three which goes back to the so-called J.

370
00:50:36,91 --> 00:50:43,13
Three or the generally age or the ignorance period for example

371
00:50:43,13 --> 00:50:59,93
and I had been any other well known I know I mean I mean well and also I wouldn't want to

372
00:50:59,93 --> 00:51:02,32
and other people other people

373
00:51:02,32 --> 00:51:09,52
but you know I was not I wasn't prepared to do this you know because if you're not then I'd like to go back to the last

374
00:51:09,52 --> 00:51:11,29
thing which you said about a critic could I make.

375
00:51:11,48 --> 00:51:11,93
Yeah

376
00:51:11,93 --> 00:51:20,59
but what if you feel what to what are you doing with your say your use you see you see that also not as disconnected

377
00:51:20,59 --> 00:51:24,25
from the people but it's somehow it's a language form that it's not.

378
00:51:24,48 --> 00:51:32,16
I mean I mean I mean the poetry was OK It was not definitely not connected it was it you know

379
00:51:32,16 --> 00:51:39,18
and a cultural context of course because this boy three describes of it people describes their relationship with their

380
00:51:39,18 --> 00:51:39,89
environment.

381
00:51:39,98 --> 00:51:48,01
Describes also their understanding of the world you know at that time I mean

382
00:51:48,01 --> 00:51:56,5
when we go back to the court on what on if you were saying that you're now with what you're finding you were finding

383
00:51:56,5 --> 00:52:03,99
you weren't also for the Koran. Or you find you. Not findings you know as well. No I mean. Well.

384
00:52:07,24 --> 00:52:12,7
There are certain core and accords that could be interpreted in different ways you know I mean.

385
00:52:12,93 --> 00:52:17,17
OK the Arab exhibits they contributed a lot to understanding

386
00:52:18,37 --> 00:52:27,84
but in some cases we can do more for to understand this text through through the languages that existed in

387
00:52:27,84 --> 00:52:35,67
and maybe at that time. Because it's they they are have all they're also their roots.

388
00:52:36,04 --> 00:52:43,14
Yes of course I mean such words they have their own roots in their language about it before Islam

389
00:52:43,56 --> 00:52:50,98
and yeah I mean we have for example some words that were you know they became Arabic you know although they are foreign

390
00:52:50,98 --> 00:52:58,39
words foreign words but there they became Arabic and they became part of the Arabian linguistic culture

391
00:52:59,63 --> 00:53:06,48
and you found in you found them. You know and different maybe and texts and also the period.

392
00:53:07,15 --> 00:53:13,00
They are known some of them are known and the connected. Because they're not in fact.

393
00:53:13,69 --> 00:53:17,98
They were they were foreign words but they were Arab eyes you know and they took the Arabic shape.

394
00:53:18,44 --> 00:53:25,3
You know as you know as usual in interchange between languages. It's known you know.

395
00:53:26,6 --> 00:53:28,29
You can you're discovering that now.

396
00:53:29,25 --> 00:53:33,92
Well I'm trying to yeah you know to deal with certain words

397
00:53:33,92 --> 00:53:41,82
and understanding to understand them in in a different context.

398
00:53:43,96 --> 00:53:50,9
I mean to interpret them in the light of ancient semantic languages that existed in Arabia before Islam.

399
00:53:52,08 --> 00:53:59,99
And how can you give examples. Yes there are some examples in.

400
00:54:00,87 --> 00:54:13,16
For example the verse in National Park has been interpreted we opened your chests

401
00:54:13,16 --> 00:54:16,59
and you know there are different interpretations

402
00:54:16,76 --> 00:54:25,7
but we have to go back to for example to ancient South Arabian linguistic culture we find that the Shanahan means to

403
00:54:25,7 --> 00:54:29,23
predict which means. In fact if we reinterpret.

404
00:54:30,91 --> 00:54:38,71
It means that we I mean the god has protected Mohammed's brother Mohammed starts.

405
00:54:39,06 --> 00:54:43,31
You know this is you know this helps us to understand the thinks in a better way

406
00:54:43,76 --> 00:54:51,31
and it is in it's for the benefit of course and in fact you know it's there for the benefit of course I mean. To use.

407
00:54:52,53 --> 00:55:03,7
I mean to use the languages and to shed light on through other language other Arabian languages. OK then we go back to.

408
00:55:04,72 --> 00:55:09,78
When you were with your student you were with your students in the mountains.

409
00:55:09,81 --> 00:55:19,02
You're looking at these storms in this norm of terrain with when you when you when you look for them for yourself

410
00:55:19,79 --> 00:55:27,2
when you invision your your future your to dream of what they can do what you can do here in this area.

411
00:55:27,61 --> 00:55:32,08
What what would you how do you envision that over ten fifteen years.

412
00:55:33,41 --> 00:55:40,61
Well how do I envision my students or in the field and just sort of part of press room

413
00:55:42,62 --> 00:55:49,00
when you look at your your your field of work with your students you walk into a bank research.

414
00:55:49,34 --> 00:55:54,98
It's what you would you explain for what do you envision for the coming ten years.

415
00:55:55,14 --> 00:56:01,42
What do you want them to find out that you yourself to find out. Well.

416
00:56:01,87 --> 00:56:05,3
In fact I would like to continue in this field

417
00:56:05,5 --> 00:56:16,72
and of course I hope that the can that my students can continue as well because this is a message that we have to hand

418
00:56:16,78 --> 00:56:19,83
out to other future generations

419
00:56:19,83 --> 00:56:29,68
and I hope that we can establish a kind of a school I mean a school academic school you know to understand that aims at

420
00:56:29,68 --> 00:56:30,41
understanding.

421
00:56:32,21 --> 00:56:36,96
Maybe in culture from and maybe in peninsula and also in their live

422
00:56:36,96 --> 00:56:47,45
and that's what I am that there continue the same discipline and also the continue and also

423
00:56:47,45 --> 00:56:50,36
and training of future generations and

424
00:56:50,36 --> 00:56:56,72
when you look because you walk into limitations you said you were the first one that shed a light.

425
00:56:59,58 --> 00:57:04,05
But much of the people you didn't see the light you know what do you think your students will.

426
00:57:04,78 --> 00:57:10,96
What kind of Windows are able to open. Well I hope. You know.

427
00:57:12,68 --> 00:57:20,08
I mean they can of course they CAN I don't know I mean it's of course their decision to follow my discipline or not.

428
00:57:21,11 --> 00:57:33,03
But it's definitely the are going to contribute understanding. Culture and it's why the widest context.

429
00:57:35,15 --> 00:57:39,81
I like them to I mean on the history of Arabic.

430
00:57:40,5 --> 00:57:52,00
I mean I would advise them to work on the history of Arabic as a language and culture. And. For the future.

431
00:57:52,00 --> 00:57:58,82
I think they're there because they are they have now a wide knowledge I mean a wide knowledge.

432
00:58:01,17 --> 00:58:10,31
Modern Languages and also an ancient languages and they have also given ability they are capable to deal with.

433
00:58:11,24 --> 00:58:18,21
With other cultures. I mean not only I mean another instance cultures also more than cultures in the world.

434
00:58:18,8 --> 00:58:26,46
I think they have more opportunity than I have what they had before. And a lot of storms too.

435
00:58:27,08 --> 00:58:37,29
Yes I mean I mean OK they have we have to continue I mean documenting the inscriptions spread spread all over the

436
00:58:37,29 --> 00:58:48,01
Jordanian reign and I mean this needs. Many generations I mean. In the future to be prepared for this task you know.

437
00:58:48,46 --> 00:58:52,3
It's not a task of one generation or two generations

438
00:58:52,3 --> 00:58:59,96
and we have to train many generations so that they can continue documenting our cultural heritage.

439
00:59:00,72 --> 00:59:09,81
Not only stones and inscriptions but also. You know archaeology and tangible heritage and intangible heritage.

440
00:59:10,07 --> 00:59:19,52
You know I mean you can't divide culture you know into parts you know they are all are all interconnected you know a

441
00:59:19,52 --> 00:59:26,44
lot of aspects that are interconnected and can you know by studying.

442
00:59:27,05 --> 00:59:35,65
These aspects we can draw you know clear picture about about our culture. What are you doing now.

443
00:59:35,93 --> 00:59:49,35
What was what is your. No different projects and research. And diverse in general.

444
00:59:50,62 --> 01:00:02,9
While I'm now conducting a field work along. You know I mean. So field work which I'm going to continue.

445
01:00:04,63 --> 01:00:13,77
For the next few years in the so called head of our region in the volcanic region we visited.

446
01:00:15,41 --> 01:00:24,81
Because and I'm also trying to involve foreign institutions to. To work with me and in this field work.

447
01:00:26,56 --> 01:00:32,32
I mean it is I mean we are trying to document as far as possible.

448
01:00:33,23 --> 01:00:41,98
North Arabian inscriptions from north in Jordan and from from the so-called from the so-called northeast and bad.

449
01:00:43,96 --> 01:00:54,04
It is has a lot of. I mean the surfaces of stones constitute an ideal canvas for writing inscriptions.

450
01:00:54,94 --> 01:01:02,62
Those inscriptions I mean were written by people who you know who were in the area.

451
01:01:04,04 --> 01:01:07,61
I mean maybe they had the big one collector but it is not definite.

452
01:01:08,92 --> 01:01:13,11
And there is a countless number of inscriptions in this area

453
01:01:13,41 --> 01:01:20,84
and they need to be documented for a future studies so that we understand more and more about the people

454
01:01:20,84 --> 01:01:28,7
and the area and the history of the area around you hold you know this was a land of milk and.

455
01:01:29,55 --> 01:01:34,91
You know I mean one big archeological black hole they were still have to discover.

456
01:01:35,28 --> 01:01:44,01
Yes I mean I'm not the only person you know. In fact and my institute versity and the other Institute today.

457
01:01:46,22 --> 01:01:49,17
You're have found out that we are trying to train.

458
01:01:50,13 --> 01:01:50,84
Students

459
01:01:50,84 --> 01:01:59,64
and to train new generation to take the burden you know to continue with this responsibility in studying their cultural

460
01:01:59,64 --> 01:01:59,98
heritage.

461
01:02:00,11 --> 01:02:00,63
Jordan

462
01:02:01,08 --> 01:02:08,25
but it's so I want to say all these rocks have you have a story yourself you are one shot fired that found some of the

463
01:02:08,25 --> 01:02:17,21
stories but I mean this is one big. Landscape of rocks want to get yes in fact this is this is true but.

464
01:02:19,46 --> 01:02:25,15
This is this is I mean everywhere you find inscriptions everywhere you find.

465
01:02:25,83 --> 01:02:32,55
Aspects of cultural heritage here in Jordan. And you as I said we need generations and generations.

466
01:02:33,36 --> 01:02:36,87
That continue to document and study this cultural heritage.

467
01:02:37,48 --> 01:02:42,75
It is evidence that this area contributed in the human history. It is an evidence.

468
01:02:42,89 --> 01:02:50,95
What we see here is an evidence that this area this region contributed to the human creativity it's an evidence on cue

469
01:02:50,95 --> 01:03:04,03
and human creativity and you know we are trying to. To widen the snail I mean to widen the spectrum of this knowledge.

470
01:03:05,22 --> 01:03:06,67
Not only among the academics

471
01:03:06,67 --> 01:03:13,92
but also among the local communities so that they can feel that they have you know they have all the history

472
01:03:13,92 --> 01:03:19,57
and they are proud proud of the sort that they understand of all this really they're proud of it.

473
01:03:19,6 --> 01:03:25,91
So yes this is our intention I mean not only studying the cultural heritage in academic way

474
01:03:26,34 --> 01:03:34,94
but also to let people know to let the community know that they have been to story which contributed in the development

475
01:03:34,94 --> 01:03:44,9
of humanity as part of the development of civilizations. It's quite a struggle. Yeah I mean.

476
01:03:45,88 --> 01:03:58,56
I don't know but this is something. You know it is but this is evident you know I mean as you see you know. For you.

477
01:03:58,59 --> 01:04:03,36
It's this is also. For the people. I mean for the people I don't think so.

478
01:04:03,55 --> 01:04:10,49
I don't think that all people endured and it's evident for them that. That better off for example.

479
01:04:12,57 --> 01:04:16,93
That it's contributed in the human development and human civil a civilization

480
01:04:16,93 --> 01:04:22,17
and I mean my father for example he never visited Petra.

481
01:04:22,26 --> 01:04:29,55
You know I mean he's from the local Jordanian community but he didn't visit the visit before you know.

482
01:04:30,1 --> 01:04:35,45
Him and I'm speaking my myself you know. Why not.

483
01:04:36,31 --> 01:04:44,00
Well you know he's you know he's seventy two years old he's a he has his own interests.

484
01:04:44,00 --> 01:04:47,35
You know he's a businessman and he's not interested in.

485
01:04:47,7 --> 01:04:57,95
This field but you know I well I promised him to take him to Petra and maybe in two years

486
01:04:57,95 --> 01:05:06,68
and I'm trying to convince him you know but you know my concern is a difficult to convince him you are one hundred.

487
01:05:06,94 --> 01:05:14,78
Yes I'm going to say this is this is the paradox is because I'm the one who should make him aware of our ancient.

488
01:05:15,85 --> 01:05:30,13
Engine turreted but I'm now concerned. What you're saying is it's strange. Your father. Yes. You won't open the window.

489
01:05:30,14 --> 01:05:35,33
Your father has to be convinced to join you looked through the window. Yes through my window.

490
01:05:36,63 --> 01:05:41,2
Yes this is a kind of paradox you know I can't explain that bit

491
01:05:41,2 --> 01:05:47,69
but he didn't get the right education to be aware of the importance of our cultural heritage

492
01:05:47,69 --> 01:05:58,09
but we are trying this with a new generation now but when you look at this paradox because your father stands for.

493
01:05:58,31 --> 01:06:06,63
Much more people. Stands for Jordan for the general opinion about it not the sort of general opinion.

494
01:06:06,87 --> 01:06:13,61
You know I mean in his age. There are people who are interested in what interested in this heritage.

495
01:06:14,32 --> 01:06:21,96
It's sometimes you feel alone it's sometimes difficult to know so much of those beautiful Eric era.

496
01:06:22,83 --> 01:06:26,46
And those you see so many people are going to convince

497
01:06:26,46 --> 01:06:33,79
or try to convince it's good it's also a lonely feeling that you have one of the few that stands.

498
01:06:33,81 --> 01:06:39,44
Yes sometimes yes you know this is true. I feel myself myself sometimes.

499
01:06:40,00 --> 01:06:47,06
Alone even among my colleagues you know and then there's the how come you know I mean I mean not in my faculty

500
01:06:47,06 --> 01:06:52,79
but in general you know yeah but it was you know young generation now is interested in different things.

501
01:06:52,88 --> 01:07:01,26
You know and I and Business Administration finance it's a thing I you know and. This field is not.

502
01:07:02,88 --> 01:07:04,77
OK it's respected Jordan

503
01:07:04,77 --> 01:07:17,85
but students mostly are interested are young generation is interested in majors through which they can add money.

504
01:07:18,11 --> 01:07:23,56
You know. And I have to admit you know. Through archaeology and heritage.

505
01:07:25,3 --> 01:07:33,81
This is sometimes difficult you know so that makes that makes you love it. Well yeah maybe.

506
01:07:33,91 --> 01:07:41,3
Yes Yeah maybe but I have some colleagues here in Jordan with whom with whom I can communicate and exchange ideas

507
01:07:41,3 --> 01:07:50,38
and I have also leagues from Europe and the states and the United States. And we exchange ideas and opinions.

508
01:07:51,29 --> 01:07:59,4
But mostly we remain in the academic real you know that's that that's the problem and the challenge now how to.

509
01:08:00,48 --> 01:08:03,09
Raise awareness about the importance.

510
01:08:03,39 --> 01:08:11,27
I mean how to raise awareness among them community members about this important cultural heritage which should be

511
01:08:11,27 --> 01:08:17,76
disseminated you know and get known to a wide range of people. This is a challenge.

512
01:08:17,78 --> 01:08:26,09
I mean OK as an academic I do my part but there are other there are other parties that can work with us.

513
01:08:26,19 --> 01:08:31,43
You know for example the media and media can reach everybody in his in his room

514
01:08:31,43 --> 01:08:37,87
and I think we have to work on this now for the next stage. Yeah.

515
01:08:38,3 --> 01:08:40,33
And the and then

516
01:08:40,33 --> 01:08:49,38
when you do you start with the rest of your history of Georgia because it's also it has to be yet discovered

517
01:08:49,38 --> 01:08:55,67
or as should be you know it had to be studied the schools covered explore. But I'm.

518
01:08:56,3 --> 01:09:03,92
I'm just one person you know and that's why I said we have to build a generation to get involved in studying.

519
01:09:05,74 --> 01:09:12,25
This culture. What is your.

520
01:09:13,62 --> 01:09:15,69
What is your dream when you

521
01:09:15,69 --> 01:09:22,38
when you think in ten fifteen years what what what what is it what's your ideal Jordan look like. Jordan.

522
01:09:22,4 --> 01:09:34,55
You know your your and my field. If you your faith. Is I expect I hope and wish that we were going to.

523
01:09:36,45 --> 01:09:42,83
Going to establish an academic school here in Jordan academic school not in terms of university

524
01:09:42,83 --> 01:09:53,37
or in the way of thinking in this field and I think I am part of this generation now because I was trained in Jordan.

525
01:09:53,55 --> 01:10:01,6
I mean for my be a and and I am very proud to get my first training in Jordan. And it was consolidated.

526
01:10:02,55 --> 01:10:07,66
By my study in Germany and my in my academic stays in Europe and the in the United States

527
01:10:08,8 --> 01:10:12,44
and I'm sure that we are going further

528
01:10:12,78 --> 01:10:23,53
and tried with with them with the future generation of course to build this academic schools this. I mean academic.

529
01:10:24,73 --> 01:10:29,24
School of thought and in the field of cultural heritage in general.

530
01:10:31,26 --> 01:10:35,75
And when you look at the fields where you're researching where we were before you know.

531
01:10:37,39 --> 01:10:43,93
It's like that's quite a lot of work also storms are all the stones already.

532
01:10:45,51 --> 01:10:46,37
Not all of the stones

533
01:10:46,37 --> 01:10:55,21
and we have seen yesterday we had to penetrate in the desert for forty four to forty kilometers to find a place to find

534
01:10:55,21 --> 01:11:03,65
the site where we. Work before. And yes I mean there is a countless number of such inscriptions spread over the.

535
01:11:04,26 --> 01:11:08,25
Stones of the desert right there in the north. I mean North Eastern bad.

536
01:11:08,92 --> 01:11:13,71
And of course they need the expertise they need you know scholars they need more.

537
01:11:14,61 --> 01:11:18,6
Trained students and also research institutions.

538
01:11:19,47 --> 01:11:27,89
It was just a once a day that it was tablets you know a kind of research research center there you know

539
01:11:27,89 --> 01:11:38,12
and the desert you know so that so that. Such inscriptions such such science can be easily accessible to us.

540
01:11:38,43 --> 01:11:43,46
Yeah I mean this is one of my dreams you know the established research center out of them.

541
01:11:43,97 --> 01:11:47,41
And where do they publish their findings.

542
01:11:47,61 --> 01:11:54,58
Well usually we have either republished the findings in books published them

543
01:11:54,58 --> 01:11:59,91
and journals in different languages German and.

544
01:12:01,61 --> 01:12:06,63
Yeah I mean those languages are accessible for us and sometimes

545
01:12:06,63 --> 01:12:10,96
and French because some colleagues some of my colleagues.

546
01:12:11,61 --> 01:12:17,77
Graduated from France and England for example and there are some you know they prefer to write

547
01:12:17,77 --> 01:12:22,68
and the languages they they master. And here in Jordan.

548
01:12:23,35 --> 01:12:30,93
Yes of course we have in fact the economic situation and the level of education in Jordan is.

549
01:12:33,98 --> 01:12:42,29
Good here and it has its has a high standard in comparison to other institutions. In the region but can you.

550
01:12:42,38 --> 01:12:52,32
For example also stories that shed light on this era. Is it easy to to share it with the general public.

551
01:12:52,4 --> 01:12:59,91
A lot then of course yes. Yeah this is yeah I mean we can share it with the public.

552
01:12:59,93 --> 01:13:08,56
I mean we hold conferences about our new discoveries. I think it will we are planning for a workshop.

553
01:13:08,69 --> 01:13:16,35
I think in two thousand and sixteen on this subject of a new discoveries

554
01:13:16,35 --> 01:13:19,44
and Jordan new African discoveries in Jordan

555
01:13:19,44 --> 01:13:32,42
and I mean there is no problem to share the information with the public because I mean sometimes we compose our

556
01:13:32,42 --> 01:13:40,23
articles and research papers in Arabic and I mean Arabic is accessible for every for everybody in Jordan.

557
01:13:40,52 --> 01:13:45,79
Nobody can imagine what I would also meaning is it is sometimes I suppose difficult.

558
01:13:46,76 --> 01:13:55,61
To do when there you have a lot of people who think of the time before as ignorant time to.

559
01:13:56,17 --> 01:14:01,18
To to to let them know look through this window you see you see. World. Yes.

560
01:14:01,68 --> 01:14:10,63
Like what you're saying about about what you're doing with yeah yeah yeah you know better you know this through back

561
01:14:10,63 --> 01:14:14,78
the best way is to do implement our to use the.

562
01:14:15,58 --> 01:14:21,26
Modern media possibilities to make the people aware about what they are discovering.

563
01:14:22,55 --> 01:14:30,3
And I'm trying my best now to convince my university. To integrate you know.

564
01:14:31,82 --> 01:14:39,63
This discipline this academic discipline into a different. And to different fields.

565
01:14:39,74 --> 01:14:44,31
You know not only in archaeology in a political context

566
01:14:44,31 --> 01:14:51,69
but also in the maybe in the faculty in the department of our it because that is you know there's the other fix that is

567
01:14:51,69 --> 01:14:52,93
the part about of the studies

568
01:14:52,93 --> 01:15:02,17
and departments of Arabic stars in the Arab world we are in fact not you know totally concerned with the.

569
01:15:02,68 --> 01:15:07,8
With the ancient sources that we encounter and E.B.M. Before Islam.

570
01:15:08,32 --> 01:15:21,82
What is the essence of what they are finding what you're finding Yes In fact it's very essential to understand you know

571
01:15:21,87 --> 01:15:33,1
cultural historical aspects on the basis of inscriptions For example we know that Arabia has had always a constant

572
01:15:33,25 --> 01:15:37,15
contact with the with the surrounding I mean.

573
01:15:37,67 --> 01:15:40,81
That we discovered through the inscriptions through the texts

574
01:15:41,39 --> 01:15:46,76
and we know that for example that Arabia had contacts with Egypt with the with the greenies with the.

575
01:15:48,94 --> 01:15:59,51
With the other with modern Turkey and minor and also with other remote areas for example.

576
01:16:00,22 --> 01:16:10,89
Scimitar Semites there they reached you know Morrocco and Tunisia and Morocco and through the NS corruptions we can.

577
01:16:11,89 --> 01:16:17,49
Find out how those people have this image that people in this area we're in a strong

578
01:16:17,49 --> 01:16:23,27
and constant contact with other people in the world but why is it.

579
01:16:23,82 --> 01:16:26,75
You work you work you find all these findings

580
01:16:26,75 --> 01:16:33,67
and it's very important from a should we can we look around in a part of the world where all kind of conflicts emerge

581
01:16:33,67 --> 01:16:38,23
now round Jordan. Which is all about historical.

582
01:16:40,48 --> 01:16:47,98
Well Mr conceptions also I mean you have all kind of you have you have countries that say you have to believe this

583
01:16:47,98 --> 01:16:56,13
and if you do it like that you have groups that say it's like this you should do to our steps can imagine that that is

584
01:16:56,13 --> 01:17:03,13
a lovely feeling when you are in this in this. Part of the world where they treat history.

585
01:17:03,67 --> 01:17:12,93
Yes In fact that's why it we have to understand history and the proper way. I mean we don't have to history.

586
01:17:13,32 --> 01:17:20,89
You know this is this is the most dangerous think and you know every group.

587
01:17:21,49 --> 01:17:28,89
You know tries to say that I am I'm the one who follows that I know that I through a you know

588
01:17:28,99 --> 01:17:31,89
but this is this is not true. I mean we have.

589
01:17:32,81 --> 01:17:43,35
Basic ground basic ground which we have to understand to understand it as it is you know we don't have to reflect our

590
01:17:43,42 --> 01:17:50,28
political you know political backgrounds or. The culture of political ties.

591
01:17:50,75 --> 01:18:01,57
I don't know whether I'm using the right word. If we understand culture and religion as well in the. Political context.

592
01:18:02,26 --> 01:18:08,95
Definitely the reason there is a lot will be will be dangerous. You see that.

593
01:18:09,56 --> 01:18:19,17
Yes In fact that's what what's happening now in fact in the surrounding the surrounding region. It's difficult.

594
01:18:20,09 --> 01:18:26,98
Every every group has its own understanding and. They defend that in different ways.

595
01:18:28,04 --> 01:18:35,06
Because the of the lack of cultural The I look you know and I'm dreaming of.

596
01:18:37,15 --> 01:18:43,84
Could you explain to me what it means what you are doing and what people you work for tutoring for the and handsome

597
01:18:43,84 --> 01:18:46,12
and of identity. Richmond's of the identity.

598
01:18:47,29 --> 01:18:56,51
Yes In fact maybe as you have seen that I'm working in different fields but out of there are interrelated.

599
01:18:57,34 --> 01:19:07,42
I'm using the information contained in the inscriptions. To. In order to reach a certain result. You know.

600
01:19:07,74 --> 01:19:16,87
And I'm using also information gained from cultural heritage in general especially the intangible cultural heritage to

601
01:19:18,47 --> 01:19:28,17
put search results together to show how cultural heritage and general. Is important for identity.

602
01:19:29,28 --> 01:19:37,85
In fact identity is not contained only inscriptions but also in other sources I mean for example the A.B.N.

603
01:19:37,85 --> 01:19:45,25
Poetry is part of our history as part of our identity on the Arabic poetry

604
01:19:45,6 --> 01:19:55,73
and also the holy book is also part of our identity because it's written in Arabic and I think it's very crucial

605
01:19:55,73 --> 01:19:59,99
and important. To understand what the.

606
01:20:00,01 --> 01:20:05,2
Others wrote about the Koran and there are several institutions in there in Europe

607
01:20:05,2 --> 01:20:08,31
and in the United States who take care.

608
01:20:08,8 --> 01:20:16,17
I mean that study in a different from a different perspective and a different methodology.

609
01:20:17,71 --> 01:20:23,97
A lot of studies appeared in the last twenty years about from Germany France and other.

610
01:20:25,56 --> 01:20:31,5
And other countries in the world but I have the problem.

611
01:20:33,34 --> 01:20:40,08
I think I would so just be going to make institutions in the Arab world. To start.

612
01:20:41,32 --> 01:20:48,21
Understanding what the Europeans wrote about this about this book about this holy book in fact.

613
01:20:48,62 --> 01:20:55,85
And so that we can understand from the methodology to live in how the European scholars study.

614
01:20:57,48 --> 01:21:12,07
Because studying the traditionally would traditionally without taking into consideration the new publications written

615
01:21:12,07 --> 01:21:21,6
in different languages. For example in German French or Russian No I think it would lead to kind of.

616
01:21:23,48 --> 01:21:31,49
I don't know could lead to a kind of mis understanding of the others and there were concerns on

617
01:21:33,39 --> 01:21:43,73
and because I mean it's for me important to show how how Europeans dealt with the core

618
01:21:43,73 --> 01:21:49,5
and generally especially in the last twenty thirty years ago. All the literature about.

619
01:21:51,57 --> 01:21:59,93
Mostly translated into Arabic and we knew what the contents of it but in the last twenty thirty years we have.

620
01:22:00,6 --> 01:22:04,82
I mean Arab scholars who has no access to funnel languages.

621
01:22:06,17 --> 01:22:10,69
This will remain for them close to me in the literature

622
01:22:10,69 --> 01:22:17,81
and written in other languages other languages remains for them closed you know there are a lot about it.

623
01:22:18,18 --> 01:22:29,77
That's why I said just that we. We are translating this into a brick. That's the core of who you are.

624
01:22:29,83 --> 01:22:39,65
I mean language is the key. Yes are the key of cultures. And also to stand identity your own identity.

625
01:22:39,68 --> 01:22:41,68
Yes of course I mean studying.

626
01:22:43,4 --> 01:22:55,19
Well studying ancient written sources that are written in Arabian languages and studying also cultural connotations.

627
01:22:58,59 --> 01:23:04,77
Their cultural backgrounds and this would should the light on the people who who wrote the mistakes

628
01:23:04,77 --> 01:23:11,09
and also make them feel proud about our identity and understanding

629
01:23:11,99 --> 01:23:22,24
and to understand that in a proper way to share for that reason the language the language is a language is form the

630
01:23:22,24 --> 01:23:31,66
basis for years of course I mean I mean I mean the languages are out of the keys out of the keys to two cultures

631
01:23:34,09 --> 01:23:39,29
and culture of cultural value values are contained in cultures

632
01:23:39,81 --> 01:23:46,39
and studying the languages is of course the key to understand the cultural backgrounds.

633
01:23:48,17 --> 01:23:56,51
I mean especially in regarding civilisations because they are you know they don't exist anymore

634
01:23:56,51 --> 01:24:04,71
but we have their takes that that have been lifted. By those who composed composed them. We can get.

635
01:24:05,92 --> 01:24:18,46
Get some glimpses about the cultural background from from the sticks and they would help us and Hansing the identity.

636
01:24:19,7 --> 01:24:24,07
That's why your put work is so important. Thank you so much. Don't you think yourself.

637
01:24:24,28 --> 01:24:32,8
You know of course I mean I think it's an important discipline which should be. I mean which should be supported.

638
01:24:33,34 --> 01:24:41,55
I mean every Jordanian institution. Going to make institution and draining.

639
01:24:42,23 --> 01:24:46,99
Yes of course I mean first of all we have to start in the academic institutions.

640
01:24:47,65 --> 01:24:53,51
And then we should think in a further step how to disseminate this knowledge among.

641
01:24:54,42 --> 01:24:59,44
The local communities so that also people that visit. Petra for example.

642
01:24:59,89 --> 01:25:04,73
Understand what that really is and that's just like us because now it's sometimes used as a kind of.

643
01:25:06,04 --> 01:25:09,8
Not only you know this is the difficult story to tell because a now.

644
01:25:10,6 --> 01:25:22,92
Is being consumed if we remain investing it in this way I feel that is part of our identity here in Jordan

645
01:25:23,18 --> 01:25:34,17
and we have to preserve it and save guard as a culture of space. You know for the future generations because it is.

646
01:25:34,18 --> 01:25:38,18
I mean a site like but that is.

647
01:25:39,47 --> 01:25:48,83
Is a place which is unparalleled I mean in the world and we are very proud to have it

648
01:25:48,83 --> 01:25:59,8
but we have in the same time to do our best to safeguard it and also to present it in a proper way. And.

649
01:26:00,04 --> 01:26:08,69
In addition to this into. Its being as part of our identity in Jordan.

650
01:26:09,32 --> 01:26:20,33
I think it's also a source for income generation for for the national income. And I mean we can do. I mean.

651
01:26:20,66 --> 01:26:22,74
We have the ability year in Jordan to.

652
01:26:24,34 --> 01:26:33,02
To start working on the site in a proper way to conserve it and to safeguard it for future generations.

653
01:26:33,56 --> 01:26:43,12
Yeah I mean this this this is also can be applied to other sites in Jordan as you mentioned before Jordan is a museum.

654
01:26:43,18 --> 01:26:48,74
You know it's an open museum. I mean if you travel from the north to the south.

655
01:26:48,77 --> 01:26:55,14
You always encounter cultural had a cultural heritage sites or nature inside.

656
01:26:55,68 --> 01:27:02,61
And they constitute of course are part of our local identity but they only have to see it.

657
01:27:02,84 --> 01:27:12,16
Yes I mean this is an important thing as well we have to make the people were aware of importance of such

658
01:27:12,16 --> 01:27:18,01
archaeological science or heritage science in general and. You know it was my understanding it.

659
01:27:18,12 --> 01:27:24,82
Stand their own identity. You know definitely and that was there and stand there more than just an Islamic.

660
01:27:25,79 --> 01:27:39,06
Or just more than history in fact I feel that this part of this is not. I mean.

661
01:27:39,96 --> 01:27:45,96
OK I mean I mean Islam is also as part of our history part of our identity

662
01:27:45,96 --> 01:27:53,77
and I mean if you want to I don't know if you want to you want me to say it again where you can say it's.

663
01:27:54,69 --> 01:28:03,51
You can say it again or you like. Yes In fact it's not only. The cultural heritage is part of our identity and.

664
01:28:04,34 --> 01:28:08,58
The identity the religious identity of the people who are living in Jordan.

665
01:28:10,22 --> 01:28:15,71
Is part of the entire identity of the Jordanian community.

666
01:28:16,64 --> 01:28:21,04
I mean we have Muslims we have Christians here in Jordan but they constitute them.

667
01:28:22,78 --> 01:28:31,88
Both religions here in Jordan are part of our identity as Jordanians in the whole Arab whole game as are ups of course.

668
01:28:35,23 --> 01:28:43,73
So a lot of work to do for you. Yes In fact I am an individual but I'm trying my best and.

669
01:28:45,31 --> 01:28:55,69
As I mentioned I hope that we can. Cooperate. I mean cooperate with the young generation to then to have.

670
01:28:57,35 --> 01:29:06,32
You know a group of researchers ago a group of a group of interested people not only from the economic institutions

671
01:29:06,32 --> 01:29:07,32
but also from the.

672
01:29:09,21 --> 01:29:18,19
From the local communities to work together and to cooperate so that we can enhance our identity

673
01:29:18,19 --> 01:29:22,48
and as Jordanians as Muslims Christians and as Arabs.
