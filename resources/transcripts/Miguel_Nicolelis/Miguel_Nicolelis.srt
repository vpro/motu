1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:10,45
Well you know. OK but for which she's. Not not a chance. Or not ever ever and ever actually.

2
00:00:11,12 --> 00:00:21,04
Was well because we're not machines and we're not governed by our brains do not work through algorithms

3
00:00:22,02 --> 00:00:24,76
and we don't work in binary logic.

4
00:00:24,78 --> 00:00:29,38
So we have components of our minds there are analog very important components

5
00:00:29,38 --> 00:00:35,92
and we all know that digital processes can live. They can approximate but they cannot emulate.

6
00:00:37,18 --> 00:00:44,98
Another log process particularly processes like the ones that take place in our minds.

7
00:00:46,31 --> 00:00:48,19
You know the brain is a very complex system

8
00:00:48,91 --> 00:00:56,88
and it is formed by one hundred one hundred billion elements connected to each other which are continuously adapting to

9
00:00:56,88 --> 00:00:58,81
the statistics of their outside world

10
00:00:59,64 --> 00:01:07,87
and it is at that tension that we call plasticity makes it impossible for a dish to machine then its code to run.

11
00:01:07,89 --> 00:01:09,09
So there is no software

12
00:01:09,09 --> 00:01:17,47
and hardware in the brain as the other thing very very Yet as an organic computer the brain computes with the organic

13
00:01:17,48 --> 00:01:24,79
tissue. There is no he has and then death kind of computation is not reducible to an algorithm.

14
00:01:24,85 --> 00:01:28,84
So there is no singularity coming for the human race.

15
00:01:29,05 --> 00:01:32,18
There are other problems that computers can bring to the human race

16
00:01:32,18 --> 00:01:39,35
but not replacing our minds because it Dinara Safina brain. Absolutely.

17
00:01:39,45 --> 00:01:50,04
A brain is a system dead it is a product of a evolutionary process that involved millions of random steps that cannot

18
00:01:50,04 --> 00:01:55,25
be simulated in a laboratory or in a machine. And my concern is not there.

19
00:01:55,25 --> 00:02:01,44
Computers digital computers will reproduce the brain. My main concern is there. The brain is so adaptable.

20
00:02:01,67 --> 00:02:08,36
So plastic any any absorbs everything that is relevant gives the brain.

21
00:02:09,49 --> 00:02:10,05
Larry advantage

22
00:02:10,8 --> 00:02:17,19
and a survival advantage that we've made because we are continuously exposed to computers digital machines I mean our

23
00:02:17,19 --> 00:02:23,56
this is exposure is becoming almost overwhelming. There we may start reducing our human condition.

24
00:02:24,06 --> 00:02:31,35
To mimic machines and what is going to be rewarded out there is behavior is there are similar to machines

25
00:02:31,35 --> 00:02:34,7
and so the brain would assimilate machines

26
00:02:34,7 --> 00:02:42,21
and behave like machines produce behaviors like machines eliminating the most important things that define our human

27
00:02:42,21 --> 00:02:49,95
condition. And you know you're afraid because where might be frustration from Star.

28
00:02:50,62 --> 00:02:56,05
Actually my fascination started when I read a science fiction book based ACAS more of

29
00:02:56,05 --> 00:02:59,88
when I was in high school here in Brazil and.

30
00:02:59,9 --> 00:03:04,07
It was a kind of boring book because I liked his occurs more for this science fiction books

31
00:03:04,07 --> 00:03:06,13
but then I found this book the brain.

32
00:03:06,49 --> 00:03:12,76
In one of the few books that he wrote that is not really science fiction and it was a description and in the book.

33
00:03:12,81 --> 00:03:16,74
There was no dynamics there was no physiology there was mainly anatomy.

34
00:03:17,08 --> 00:03:25,01
But I realized that I was for the first time introduced to do things the really creative everything. And.

35
00:03:25,47 --> 00:03:26,02
And then

36
00:03:26,02 --> 00:03:31,66
when I went to medical school which there were computers my computers are just coming out in the eighty's here in

37
00:03:31,66 --> 00:03:35,91
Brazil and I and I thought for a moment. OK I'm going to work.

38
00:03:35,96 --> 00:03:39,52
I'm going applications or computers in medicine because I'd like very much to have.

39
00:03:40,09 --> 00:03:43,39
And then I thought well but the ultimate computing device is the brain

40
00:03:44,45 --> 00:03:50,24
and at that time I didn't really need to know much about either computers or the brain

41
00:03:50,24 --> 00:03:56,46
but I decided that I wanted to understand the brain first and there was thirty five years ago.

42
00:03:56,95 --> 00:04:07,39
I'm still trying to understand the brain first. Because really first to New York first something first again.

43
00:04:08,73 --> 00:04:15,98
Then the next circles as you start to stand for it. Yeah when I came to neuro science in eighty two eighty three.

44
00:04:18,55 --> 00:04:21,3
Again there was no dynamics there was no time in the brain.

45
00:04:21,46 --> 00:04:26,15
Most of the descriptions were very static we talk of MAMP Skala means.

46
00:04:26,4 --> 00:04:30,3
Areas so the areas soup quits but there was no flow.

47
00:04:30,37 --> 00:04:39,42
There was the whole changing plasticity was reported in eighty three by by now one of my heroes of my good friend John

48
00:04:39,42 --> 00:04:43,61
Karr's and his colleague Mike Merzenich two papers they were rejected everywhere

49
00:04:43,61 --> 00:04:47,51
and they only got published in a new journal because people didn't want to see it.

50
00:04:47,63 --> 00:04:55,57
Their brain a proof that the adult brain was changing it was a bad adapting to lesions in the periphery that's how they

51
00:04:55,57 --> 00:05:00,54
showed it and I wasn't aware of this paper and chew eighty five.

52
00:05:01,54 --> 00:05:01,88
AM But

53
00:05:01,88 --> 00:05:09,00
when I saw the paper in our two papers actually I I started wondering if this is this is totally different than what I

54
00:05:09,00 --> 00:05:14,29
have been you know reading. And that's when I went for my Ph D.

55
00:05:14,29 --> 00:05:16,57
Here in Brazil after medical school

56
00:05:16,57 --> 00:05:23,87
and I realized that I what I want to look into the brain was the dynamics of the brain because I had a hand.

57
00:05:24,41 --> 00:05:27,81
It was very fate there was not a very concrete thing there.

58
00:05:28,87 --> 00:05:31,6
There was much more to plus this didn't just what the John

59
00:05:31,6 --> 00:05:39,78
and Mike had reported in turn out the plasticity is pretty much what matters in the brain is the central concept of the

60
00:05:39,78 --> 00:05:43,9
brain. So I'm I'm absolutely shocked that these guys have not want to love a prize yet.

61
00:05:44,15 --> 00:05:48,69
You know people have one other prices lately for a minute tiny things.

62
00:05:48,87 --> 00:05:53,87
These guys discover the essence of what the brain is about you know

63
00:05:54,87 --> 00:05:59,41
and really because they're pretty certain stand the brain as far as you.

64
00:06:00,00 --> 00:06:10,28
So I understand the immense possibility when you combine great things for future reference.

65
00:06:10,85 --> 00:06:18,00
Well we're in a way when I went to the US A man just another phenomenal guy John chip in and we had the same idea.

66
00:06:18,06 --> 00:06:22,21
We are one of the few people in the world at that time. Today's common ground. But at that time.

67
00:06:22,63 --> 00:06:23,76
If in fact people

68
00:06:25,03 --> 00:06:31,09
when they heard what we wanted to do require for multiple neurons multiple brain cells simultaneously in behaving

69
00:06:31,09 --> 00:06:34,01
animals so we could look at the dynamics of this circuit.

70
00:06:34,34 --> 00:06:40,73
Some of our colleagues more senior colleagues started we're nuts that we're crazy that there was no point in moving

71
00:06:40,73 --> 00:06:44,9
from recording the electrical signals of one there are too many near us.

72
00:06:44,94 --> 00:06:46,67
So John and I had a lot of opposition

73
00:06:47,79 --> 00:06:56,02
and our careers where you know on the fringe at that time he was already established guy but even so he was young

74
00:06:56,02 --> 00:07:00,75
and I was just nobody coming from Brazil and I opposed doc

75
00:07:01,51 --> 00:07:04,52
but it turned out that what we discussed in the early ninety's

76
00:07:04,52 --> 00:07:11,93
and the studies that we published them then I think are now pretty much at the center of neuroscience and the edge

77
00:07:11,93 --> 00:07:17,92
and in almost disparate in eighty ninety seven we had many papers published

78
00:07:17,92 --> 00:07:20,97
but people are not really pay attention to them. We discussed.

79
00:07:21,62 --> 00:07:27,14
One day that we needed a preparation you preparation to convinced our colleagues. There.

80
00:07:27,24 --> 00:07:33,12
This thing that we're talking about population coding was much more relevant than anything to have been done before in

81
00:07:33,12 --> 00:07:34,69
terms of single neurons and that's

82
00:07:34,69 --> 00:07:38,81
when we came up with the idea of brain machine interfaces of linking brains to devices.

83
00:07:39,09 --> 00:07:47,68
It was a preparation experimental part of the time that we created to test the notion that to control a device either a

84
00:07:47,68 --> 00:07:55,47
limb a real limb a leg or arm or an eye Fisher device the brain requires lots of mirrors not a single cell

85
00:07:55,47 --> 00:07:59,86
and we prove that quantitatively when you let the animals you.

86
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:05,72
Only one neuron to control a complex device where nothing happened. But when you get a population of cells.

87
00:08:05,81 --> 00:08:11,6
They're working together they were able to use just the brain activity to control devices.

88
00:08:12,32 --> 00:08:13,02
With rats

89
00:08:13,02 --> 00:08:19,35
and we did with rats first the new A year later we did that was the first paper very much interface for the modern age

90
00:08:20,15 --> 00:08:25,96
with the concept we defined a term I published a paper in Nature in two thousand that actually started with a

91
00:08:25,96 --> 00:08:33,08
description of these goals that you see here to explain what a population called means because this is the go to score

92
00:08:33,08 --> 00:08:39,09
in which a Brazilian players starts the ball without any Talim being able to touch it

93
00:08:39,09 --> 00:08:46,98
and many of the individual players knew the outcome of the play until kind of a bear to kick the ball in the goal was

94
00:08:46,98 --> 00:08:52,9
scored so that's what I was trying the message the metaphor was to explain the man of the individual neurons know what

95
00:08:52,9 --> 00:08:56,99
is going on is the population is the team there knows the outcome.

96
00:08:57,4 --> 00:09:01,11
And so I started a paper and in the middle the paper said what John

97
00:09:01,11 --> 00:09:06,32
and I have proposed a year ago we call it brain machine interface and the term was created

98
00:09:06,32 --> 00:09:09,67
and they're a year later we did in monkeys.

99
00:09:09,69 --> 00:09:13,71
And in our monkeys in one reasons one case and in two thousand

100
00:09:13,71 --> 00:09:19,94
and four we did the first human demonstration of this concept into operative procedure in Parkinsonian patients just

101
00:09:19,94 --> 00:09:20,53
for a few minutes

102
00:09:21,4 --> 00:09:27,98
but it was the first human demonstration that everything we had seen in monkeys was a political Whoa whoa whoa whoa we

103
00:09:27,98 --> 00:09:33,4
saw it was does this seem funny does neuronal seem from the properties the dynamic properties that we signed Reds

104
00:09:33,4 --> 00:09:36,44
and monkeys were there in humans. It was the same thing.

105
00:09:38,31 --> 00:09:42,75
And if same lead to magical competition or approach that we used to link and the brain.

106
00:09:42,85 --> 00:09:49,79
We were devise would work in humans and so badly is when we realized that we had something gigantic

107
00:09:49,79 --> 00:09:53,65
and there was not just a basic science apparatus

108
00:09:53,66 --> 00:09:59,3
or part of that time we had to touch something that could have clinical relevance.

109
00:10:00,00 --> 00:10:05,42
And you could advance narrow sysctl realities that we never thought about before but

110
00:10:05,42 --> 00:10:08,96
when you look at our trees our princes from certainty Yeah.

111
00:10:10,8 --> 00:10:17,93
Where are you going for I don't think anybody can answer that nobody can answer that question honestly because every

112
00:10:17,93 --> 00:10:23,32
day things are changing but is a completely different neuroscience is a completely different brain research.

113
00:10:23,59 --> 00:10:26,36
You know or if you look at the BRAIN Initiative

114
00:10:26,36 --> 00:10:33,77
and I states that I'm not part of never got invited to be everything that initiatives about is what John and I did

115
00:10:34,54 --> 00:10:39,07
and is about recording more and more near us studying only circuits paying attention

116
00:10:39,07 --> 00:10:45,18
but they never have plasticity creating technology to visualize thousands millions of neurons.

117
00:10:45,23 --> 00:10:51,47
However the emphasis is mainly on technology and I think the emphasis should be in the questions.

118
00:10:51,49 --> 00:10:57,38
It should be in the real science. You know curiosity should be the emphasis I think.

119
00:10:57,44 --> 00:11:00,23
But as you know technology in the U.S.

120
00:11:00,23 --> 00:11:06,71
Has become a month almost a religion taught to the point where some people predicted we would be replaced by technology.

121
00:11:06,73 --> 00:11:11,96
Which is against the idea that there are no derivative of a biological system

122
00:11:11,96 --> 00:11:15,94
or of can be more complex than the biological system they created that the riveted.

123
00:11:16,03 --> 00:11:18,42
Technology is just a projection of our mind

124
00:11:18,42 --> 00:11:29,00
and we can never be more complex than the mind who created the technology harem scarem is wrong nor Parker yet

125
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:39,21
but you yourself are developing in your science big steps. Well to display true.

126
00:11:39,5 --> 00:11:42,44
Well we first started with the brain machine interface concept right.

127
00:11:42,53 --> 00:11:47,5
When we discovered that we could link brains of rats monkeys

128
00:11:47,51 --> 00:11:55,00
and humans to a upper limb robotic device there was a physical robot a seven degree of freedom industrial robot

129
00:11:55,00 --> 00:12:01,44
and he worked. That was the first thing but then we said why why need to be a problem. Why could it be lower limb.

130
00:12:01,52 --> 00:12:06,59
Nobody went for we're the only lab one of the few labs in the world perhaps two or three labs in the world.

131
00:12:06,72 --> 00:12:13,27
They said OK let's try for Lex and he works. And so and then we said well why he has to be a robot.

132
00:12:13,31 --> 00:12:16,68
Why can't I be a virtual device can a brain.

133
00:12:17,1 --> 00:12:24,47
Incorporate a victory device as if it were a part of the subjects body a real you know flesh and bone. And you Art.

134
00:12:24,74 --> 00:12:33,89
We put our avatar of limbs and legs or arms and the monkey is treated that after a while as if they were a third

135
00:12:33,89 --> 00:12:34,65
or fourth.

136
00:12:34,8 --> 00:12:37,56
So we had my kids we're four limbs two biological

137
00:12:38,45 --> 00:12:45,07
and two literal same thing with legs then we said wow the actuator doesn't need to be next to the monkey.

138
00:12:45,15 --> 00:12:48,94
So we put her back to we're in Japan a robot in Japan

139
00:12:48,94 --> 00:12:54,69
and we had a monkey in the United States controlling the across the globe and longer be hoed.

140
00:12:55,14 --> 00:13:01,42
The monkey assimilated the legs of the robots as if you know it were there are his own legs

141
00:13:02,11 --> 00:13:07,71
and you could stop the treadmill when the mike was walking and Duke. And he would still keep imagining.

142
00:13:07,73 --> 00:13:09,71
Movements for the robot to walk in Japan.

143
00:13:10,13 --> 00:13:16,1
And as long as you give a reward you know monkeys are like us you know they need a bribe or two to work.

144
00:13:16,67 --> 00:13:21,85
And so as long as you keep giving them juice or grapes they would do that.

145
00:13:22,1 --> 00:13:27,11
So then we went further and said Why does need to be just one brain

146
00:13:28,14 --> 00:13:33,05
and could we have multiple brains collaborating mentally to act she of this movement.

147
00:13:33,47 --> 00:13:39,81
So that's what we call a brain that in we just published a year ago showing the three monkeys that though even know

148
00:13:39,81 --> 00:13:45,72
they're there next to each other because in different rooms they don't know of the existence of the other guys they can

149
00:13:45,72 --> 00:13:54,87
mentally collaborate to make a virtual army make certain movements there are enough in form to the to the monkey is how

150
00:13:54,88 --> 00:14:03,28
they should do it. And so if you give monkey one the job of controlling the axe. And Y..

151
00:14:00,22 --> 00:14:08,33
Dimensions of the movement this is a three D. Movements X. Y. and Z. Monkey wonders X. and Y. Monkey to the Y. and Z.

152
00:14:08,33 --> 00:14:16,15
In my Q three does X. and Z. You need at least two monkeys to get a three D. Out of this but if you get a third guy.

153
00:14:16,29 --> 00:14:22,1
It looks much better to the results much credit can get all rewarded very quickly and at the same time.

154
00:14:22,34 --> 00:14:30,65
Well the monkeys get together synchronize their brains and they work as if. They were part of a single brain.

155
00:14:31,07 --> 00:14:34,14
In this experiment and I think our colleagues have not seen it

156
00:14:34,14 --> 00:14:40,17
and they thought it was just a some of them thought it was just a trick just a you know some kind of Hollywood kind of

157
00:14:40,17 --> 00:14:46,25
thing is not we actually use that to show how a single brain may synchronize to operate.

158
00:14:46,88 --> 00:14:54,07
Because there's a big mystery how multiple areas of your brain actually come together at the precise moment in time to

159
00:14:54,08 --> 00:15:01,17
do a job to make my arms move to make me speak to make me reason nobody knows nobody knows what the synchronization

160
00:15:01,17 --> 00:15:05,57
happens well it turns out that if you put motor brains separately.

161
00:15:05,59 --> 00:15:13,8
And you give a common feedback to them they synchronize so I think we found a very profound rule of

162
00:15:13,8 --> 00:15:21,35
when highlight Cayle when millions of people watching T.V. The same T.V. Show around the country around the globe.

163
00:15:21,36 --> 00:15:28,97
In the horse encounters and when you're in the stadium seeing the same match the fans there.

164
00:15:29,01 --> 00:15:33,49
They all synchronize so I think we found what is going on what happens

165
00:15:33,49 --> 00:15:36,83
when multiple individuals are recruited to be part of a structure

166
00:15:36,83 --> 00:15:44,67
and that's reason I'm calling this is structure being there are multiple Lance working together beasts of birds flying

167
00:15:44,67 --> 00:15:51,56
together in a flock fish swimming together too many humans in a movie theater

168
00:15:51,56 --> 00:15:59,88
or in a stadium I'm calling these are again a computer because it is a super nice device that is computing.

169
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:06,15
In a domain analog digital computers cannot get there. Enough.

170
00:16:06,4 --> 00:16:08,97
So there is how we have evolved of these

171
00:16:08,97 --> 00:16:15,4
and of course five years ago we decided OK this clinical relevance of this thing

172
00:16:15,4 --> 00:16:22,68
and we may make people benefit from brain machine interfaces by restoring mobility to them as reason you've seen this

173
00:16:22,68 --> 00:16:29,57
lab year as what we came to Brazil and decided to do this for the World Cup first but the project has continued

174
00:16:29,57 --> 00:16:36,73
and our big biggest discovery. We're British interface I think in a decade. Is there.

175
00:16:36,75 --> 00:16:41,71
If apparently if you're exposed chronically to a use of a brain machine interface

176
00:16:41,71 --> 00:16:48,33
or a paradigm in which your control of your mind something in your getting rich visual tactile feedback you start

177
00:16:48,33 --> 00:16:51,79
getting for a paralyzed person with a lesion in the spinal cord.

178
00:16:51,9 --> 00:16:59,55
You may start getting recovery of motor in tactile behaviors Beadle old the level of the lesion which it has never been

179
00:16:59,55 --> 00:17:01,04
demonstrated with other techniques.

180
00:17:01,66 --> 00:17:09,27
So these are chronic patients many years after the accident and yet in almost eighty percent of them after two years.

181
00:17:09,62 --> 00:17:13,7
We are seeing that they are recovering control of muscles in the legs.

182
00:17:13,83 --> 00:17:17,94
They now can Few their bodies below the level the lesion

183
00:17:18,82 --> 00:17:21,98
and I think is related to the training that they were exposed to.

184
00:17:22,06 --> 00:17:30,18
There was I'm saying is we did the Create a actually a skeleton of a robotic vest controlled by brain activity

185
00:17:30,18 --> 00:17:35,76
and we asked for man to the effects of skeleton to deliver feedback back to the subject.

186
00:17:35,97 --> 00:17:38,45
So the subject every time he steps on the ground.

187
00:17:39,9 --> 00:17:46,57
There are sensors in this surface of the foot of the eggs are there detect the pressure of the contact that pressure

188
00:17:46,57 --> 00:17:52,44
signal is then deliver to the skin of the arm of the patients because it's one of the few parts of the body where the

189
00:17:52,44 --> 00:17:59,85
original We have tactile sensation and by adapting the parameters of the speed in the magnet to that is pressure away.

190
00:18:00,00 --> 00:18:04,91
On the screen. We induced the phenomena phantom limb sensation.

191
00:18:05,84 --> 00:18:12,66
So we fooled the brain of these guys to feel through their arms their legs so they report to us that they have a walk

192
00:18:12,66 --> 00:18:13,41
with their own legs

193
00:18:13,41 --> 00:18:17,92
and they are touching the ground they begin even tell you what the ground is in are they can tell where the ground is

194
00:18:17,92 --> 00:18:25,25
grass where the ground is sand or if it is hot asphalt. So these three floors they can distinguish with this system.

195
00:18:25,74 --> 00:18:33,79
But then we only want to originally to restore mobility put them in a device link the device to their brains

196
00:18:33,79 --> 00:18:37,89
and get them to walk again there was original game but one and

197
00:18:37,89 --> 00:18:44,1
but we always did the neurological examination as a routine for us. You know and we didn't expect to see any change.

198
00:18:44,15 --> 00:18:51,57
Well six months a month after the World Cup Six months after the training started we started saying that is guys were

199
00:18:51,57 --> 00:18:56,9
having motor contractions or muscles below the level of the lesion.

200
00:18:57,43 --> 00:19:04,6
And seven of these guys had a complete clinical lesion. Which means after ten years.

201
00:19:04,99 --> 00:19:09,95
Had you shouldn't see anything you should have seen motor contractions voluntary motor contractions

202
00:19:09,95 --> 00:19:12,46
or muscles they should not have doctor you're feeling.

203
00:19:12,99 --> 00:19:19,25
And they should not have visual feeling so they don't lead they couldn't feel for instance the women could not feel

204
00:19:19,25 --> 00:19:25,19
when the period days of the month are well we start getting reports from the two women who live in the projects.

205
00:19:25,23 --> 00:19:27,59
Look like I can feel when my peers coming.

206
00:19:27,79 --> 00:19:33,84
I actually can feel that I need to go to the bathroom now I can I can control my brother now several of them start

207
00:19:33,84 --> 00:19:36,81
telling us and then when we did the motor test.

208
00:19:36,99 --> 00:19:44,49
We measure quantitatively the contraction force other sudden we had a woman with twenty new terms of force which is the

209
00:19:44,49 --> 00:19:49,88
little kind of force to do you need to make to start moving and we started looking if you do muscles

210
00:19:49,88 --> 00:19:54,72
and we could attack the contractions. So we really did the classification is called Asia.

211
00:19:55,07 --> 00:19:59,93
And it is the American spinal cord injury questions a standard code. Gone step.

212
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,28
There of classify patients over the world.

213
00:20:02,83 --> 00:20:10,43
These guys were seven of them were Asia eight which means complete paralysis in one was a should be which is sort of

214
00:20:10,43 --> 00:20:18,77
intermediate. Well in six months fifty percent of them were promoted to Asia see which is partial spinal cord injury.

215
00:20:19,05 --> 00:20:27,2
Two years later remarkable and we're not talking about guys that came to sixty feet for air.

216
00:20:27,24 --> 00:20:30,75
We started training them in November two thousand and thirteen.

217
00:20:30,76 --> 00:20:35,67
So six months after their training started at a one month after the World Cup after we lost to the Dutch.

218
00:20:36,01 --> 00:20:42,61
And I shouldn't say that on camera in which my passport but it was something in the food.

219
00:20:42,68 --> 00:20:47,77
I have to say but in any event sick one month after the World Cup ended

220
00:20:47,77 --> 00:20:51,64
and we had done our demo which was seen by a one point two billion people.

221
00:20:53,43 --> 00:20:56,84
We didn't or a large protest and long

222
00:20:56,84 --> 00:21:02,87
and behold half of the patients had muscle contractions that they could control they could actually generate movements

223
00:21:02,87 --> 00:21:08,73
the visual you can see the movements. When you put them up right. They could simulate walking.

224
00:21:08,96 --> 00:21:12,57
You know and we keep doing it. We keep doing the training.

225
00:21:13,53 --> 00:21:19,28
Now this December we completed two years of training we really did the neurological exam

226
00:21:19,28 --> 00:21:30,14
and now seventy eight percent of the patients have recovered movement saw six out of eight have muscle control below

227
00:21:30,14 --> 00:21:34,21
the level is not complete. But it is something that has never been seen.

228
00:21:34,3 --> 00:21:40,14
So the hypothesis that we have based on the studies they were forgotten in the sixties and seventies.

229
00:21:40,16 --> 00:21:48,61
And Australian pathologist had done a lot of the top says in Australian spinal cord injury patients that died of

230
00:21:48,61 --> 00:21:49,01
natural causes.

231
00:21:49,61 --> 00:21:57,05
And he he realised that in the last sixty percent of the patients are classified clinically as being completely

232
00:21:57,05 --> 00:22:04,84
paralyzed. There is at least. Two to twenty percent of fibers of nerves in the spinal cord it is to connect it.

233
00:22:05,82 --> 00:22:11,45
They're not totally destroyed but they're quite very likely they went blank. I think our training.

234
00:22:11,53 --> 00:22:13,27
Now when I read this paper.

235
00:22:13,46 --> 00:22:18,99
I want my hypothesis is that the training the intensive training that we do the brain machine interface of the patients

236
00:22:18,99 --> 00:22:25,51
turn on their arms again in the brain in these neurons sister say messages down to the spinal cord through this X.

237
00:22:25,51 --> 00:22:27,37
As they were quiet but it's still there.

238
00:22:27,4 --> 00:22:36,69
So it's plasticity is what job has it might resonate predicted from over me when you were using through your future.

239
00:22:37,19 --> 00:22:40,69
Now there's a horrible feeling the possibilities are tremendous.

240
00:22:40,9 --> 00:22:46,37
You know because you have twenty five million people in this condition spinal cord injury paralysis in the world.

241
00:22:46,58 --> 00:22:54,24
Imagine now if I large percentage of them can recover some movement some control because for instance one of our

242
00:22:54,24 --> 00:22:59,96
patients while our the women in the group says now she had perineal sensation.

243
00:23:00,28 --> 00:23:04,18
She decided to become pregnant and she actually could feel the delivery.

244
00:23:04,34 --> 00:23:11,46
You know she had bladder control so she went to work two of our patients got jobs because they now could get out of

245
00:23:11,46 --> 00:23:16,43
house. They didn't need to wear diapers anymore to you know we don't think about it.

246
00:23:16,49 --> 00:23:23,61
We had one patient who was hyper tense his normal tense now because the kind of vascular system performs better

247
00:23:23,61 --> 00:23:25,18
when we're upright

248
00:23:25,18 --> 00:23:32,52
and she says one hour a day two days a week is enough for the kind of master system to recover the blood vessels to

249
00:23:32,52 --> 00:23:34,88
open up. So his blood pressure went down.

250
00:23:35,32 --> 00:23:42,05
So being up and walking is a major behavior for we humans and you know this guy's lost weight

251
00:23:42,05 --> 00:23:47,2
and some of them were overweight because of being a world wheelchair too long a decade or so off

252
00:23:47,2 --> 00:23:57,96
and for of this very important understand it's major major breakthrough for you are to understand brain connect brains.

253
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:02,67
Off drugs or what holds a future for us.

254
00:24:03,02 --> 00:24:08,2
Oh there are many things I mean you saw the prototype of our brain that for humans.

255
00:24:08,22 --> 00:24:18,09
So we're about to get a patient naïve Patient A hasn't been trained yet in our part of that which takes some weeks

256
00:24:18,09 --> 00:24:23,91
but we want to reduce this training time because the beginner train is very difficult patient has to really concentrate

257
00:24:23,91 --> 00:24:29,34
them in the beginning is a little frustrating because the brain has forgotten what is to walk.

258
00:24:29,47 --> 00:24:36,49
Actually the brain has forgotten what is the concept of having lower limbs so to virtual reality training we need to

259
00:24:36,49 --> 00:24:42,17
reintroduce to the brain the concept or you have legs this body has legs and they move.

260
00:24:42,64 --> 00:24:50,15
And we do that by having the patient try to control avatar or himself or herself walking along virtual space

261
00:24:50,15 --> 00:24:53,17
and it takes many weeks for the patients to get this done.

262
00:24:53,39 --> 00:24:58,72
Well we're going to start linking the brain of this patient a long invasive way we've E.G.

263
00:24:58,72 --> 00:25:05,59
As you saw we have a physical therapist there is really well trained in that task a normal person would now I wouldn't

264
00:25:05,59 --> 00:25:07,67
say normal but a person that can walk by herself.

265
00:25:08,77 --> 00:25:15,12
And we're going to link the brains in to begin to train ninety percent to ninety five percent of the signal comes from

266
00:25:15,12 --> 00:25:18,73
the healthy physical therapist and five

267
00:25:18,73 --> 00:25:24,13
or ten percent comes from the patient who has a spinal cord injury so he's going to get his brings about to get

268
00:25:24,13 --> 00:25:28,12
rewarded faster and he's going to have the impression there.

269
00:25:28,13 --> 00:25:34,35
He's controlling the device and I think then what your vision the context is the driving force for plus distance.

270
00:25:34,41 --> 00:25:39,91
My prediction is that we are going to celebrate the learning curve because we are going to celebrate persisting.

271
00:25:40,25 --> 00:25:41,35
So the brain.

272
00:25:41,4 --> 00:25:46,31
NET is going to have a very practical clinic up occasion almost instantaneous to burn off

273
00:25:46,31 --> 00:25:51,7
and you've written very very stars. There are very few world history is yes.

274
00:25:51,73 --> 00:25:57,00
The problem is that the noninvasive technology that we use E.G. The one that you know you just put in this.

275
00:25:57,11 --> 00:25:59,93
It doesn't have the same resolution and the same.

276
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:05,73
Information content is not as rich in information we need to the place of mathematical tricks to get information out of

277
00:26:05,73 --> 00:26:09,56
the signal. So it's not as rich as implanting things in the hat.

278
00:26:09,62 --> 00:26:14,25
So I'm not suggesting they're implant people in the head just so they play video games

279
00:26:14,25 --> 00:26:18,66
but yes is a is a proof of concept the mental collaboration.

280
00:26:18,88 --> 00:26:23,62
If we get better not invasive techniques in the future become part of all I mean E.G.

281
00:26:23,62 --> 00:26:31,85
Now is wireless here as you saw you know you can have wireless broadcasting we have a paper coming this week I'll do

282
00:26:31,85 --> 00:26:39,68
all that uses invasive technology in the monkeys showing that monkeys can learn to drive wheelchairs in open space in

283
00:26:39,68 --> 00:26:41,33
our lab mentally.

284
00:26:41,54 --> 00:26:44,92
So you see a Mikey sitting on the wheelchair and she's driving

285
00:26:44,92 --> 00:26:49,71
or he's driving there which are to the part of where we're delivering grapes.

286
00:26:50,01 --> 00:26:57,5
But every movement of their wheelchairs coming from the mind of the monkey via a wireless link.

287
00:26:57,79 --> 00:27:05,32
So is five hundred euros fine wirelessly broadcasting the signal wirelessly so the motors are there would share a turn

288
00:27:05,32 --> 00:27:08,87
around and go up to the part of very professional corner.

289
00:27:09,04 --> 00:27:16,08
Sir we already have an experiment in the lab where to work is a collaboration there are two each monkey has its own

290
00:27:16,08 --> 00:27:20,28
wheelchair. And they only get rewarded if both of them get to the part.

291
00:27:20,3 --> 00:27:28,55
So the faster monkey helps those lower Bucky to get in on the them selves together at the party at the same time so we

292
00:27:28,55 --> 00:27:31,22
are ready for any brain networking. Between two monkeys.

293
00:27:31,38 --> 00:27:36,66
You're not really you know knowing humans we're using for clinical rehab at this point

294
00:27:37,58 --> 00:27:45,27
but if yes it's conceivable that if we prove the bend with any feeling proved the Howard methods to extract information

295
00:27:45,27 --> 00:27:50,63
from this from the brain in a noninvasive way you could have over the Internet

296
00:27:50,63 --> 00:28:03,2
and millions of people collaborating on a common task so. Wow there's a future of your powers the world. In fact.

297
00:28:03,21 --> 00:28:04,94
Our there's a very good question.

298
00:28:05,1 --> 00:28:10,35
I think the in one direction we're going to increase the clinic

299
00:28:10,35 --> 00:28:16,85
or pick ations because what we saw for spinal cord injury. I think may be a political two stroke victims.

300
00:28:16,99 --> 00:28:19,93
It may be a political to other neurological disorders.

301
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:25,66
They require plasticity in effect to have a cheery that I'm about publish

302
00:28:25,66 --> 00:28:32,5
and I'm going to put in my new book of the most neurological psychiatric disorders independently of their it's your

303
00:28:32,5 --> 00:28:34,41
logic but the cause of this disease.

304
00:28:34,63 --> 00:28:39,05
Let's say Parkinson's disease is we know that you in developed markets

305
00:28:39,05 --> 00:28:42,9
or if you're of the cells that contain a particular chemical dopamine is start dying.

306
00:28:42,98 --> 00:28:47,17
OK but once they start dying what we discover him in animals

307
00:28:47,17 --> 00:28:55,55
and then in humans is that the lack of dopamine produces like a pleasure to see here a low level Corona exit

308
00:28:55,55 --> 00:28:58,46
and that explains the tram are in a difficulty to move.

309
00:28:58,8 --> 00:29:05,72
Well we discover that if we put a microchip in the spinal cord in send electrical pulses of the right frequency a tiny

310
00:29:05,72 --> 00:29:11,85
left proposes but a very high frequency we disrupt a seizure and the animals in the patients seem to get better.

311
00:29:12,8 --> 00:29:19,29
So I think this kind of concept that neurological disorders are designers of neuronal timing how they fire together.

312
00:29:19,44 --> 00:29:22,51
If they fire too much is not good together.

313
00:29:22,53 --> 00:29:30,93
So I think I'm going to in one part of my work increase the scope of the use of brain machine interfaces to treat their

314
00:29:30,93 --> 00:29:37,66
logical disorders as one. From a basic science point of view. I have two other branches.

315
00:29:37,81 --> 00:29:44,68
One is to push very hard to understand the kind of computation that the brain does that is different from digital

316
00:29:44,68 --> 00:29:45,34
machines.

317
00:29:45,57 --> 00:29:47,03
So I'm building models

318
00:29:47,03 --> 00:29:54,58
and a lot of models of the brain to it particularly study more detailed interaction of the brain magnetic fields with

319
00:29:54,58 --> 00:29:59,94
the neurons and see if this analog digital interaction does what I like.

320
00:30:00,00 --> 00:30:08,67
To say a recursive analog digital interaction explains why the brain is different from a digital machine as one line of

321
00:30:08,67 --> 00:30:14,26
work and the other is to continue to push the envelope on trying to see how large SUV quits

322
00:30:14,26 --> 00:30:20,66
and behaving animals operate so at our lab is like has now the world record the number of layers a record of

323
00:30:20,66 --> 00:30:21,24
simultaneously.

324
00:30:22,77 --> 00:30:25,26
We are getting close to two thousand neurons now

325
00:30:26,18 --> 00:30:33,64
but I think we need to increase this to about one hundred thousand to a million to start getting close to a picture

326
00:30:33,64 --> 00:30:38,44
like when you do a camera or a movie. And you have just a few pixels of the image.

327
00:30:38,5 --> 00:30:43,42
You cannot see very well but if you increase the number of pixels you start to see the granularity.

328
00:30:44,09 --> 00:30:46,1
Is there seem more and more of the image

329
00:30:46,1 --> 00:30:52,52
but you'll not necessarily need to have all the pixels of the of the photograph or the movie to see what is going on.

330
00:30:52,91 --> 00:30:58,75
So I think if we crossed the barrier of a million neurons we caught a simultaneously.

331
00:30:59,06 --> 00:31:01,45
We're going to see a lot of the movie that goes on in the brain.

332
00:31:02,62 --> 00:31:16,18
Requires recording cemetery exactly just what I mean here. And here and.

333
00:31:16,2 --> 00:31:23,3
You take three steps in this leg we feel you're sure. Yes we are we're probably three of you mean.

334
00:31:23,4 --> 00:31:33,6
What you feeling in reality is a simulation of this five different steps that our patients and their goal

335
00:31:33,6 --> 00:31:34,84
when they do the training.

336
00:31:35,05 --> 00:31:42,53
OK So they first as I said they need to we need to remain certain the brain the concept of having legs.

337
00:31:42,55 --> 00:31:45,8
So there's basically what we do.

338
00:31:45,82 --> 00:31:48,67
We put them in a virtual reality environment that you can see in a moment

339
00:31:49,44 --> 00:31:51,38
and the patient's time director with the avatar

340
00:31:52,13 --> 00:31:56,38
and we now we are very you know we started just with the global concept of walking

341
00:31:57,19 --> 00:31:59,92
but now we're actually simulating called to.

342
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:05,72
All of the specific muscles of walking which we never thought as patients would be able to do with their brains.

343
00:32:05,83 --> 00:32:09,76
They're getting specialize in control individual legs.

344
00:32:10,14 --> 00:32:15,67
We have one side of the brain for instance the right side controlling the left left leg left side comes from the right

345
00:32:15,67 --> 00:32:23,13
leg but we discovered there. We can do a physical therapy by simulating muscle contractions on the video.

346
00:32:23,21 --> 00:32:25,27
So they see a muscle or the leg contracting

347
00:32:25,27 --> 00:32:31,48
and we develop the ability to contract individual muscles which is we never thought that would happen.

348
00:32:31,99 --> 00:32:40,21
So that's the first step is the virtual reality then being go to the robotic device the robot standing on the treadmill.

349
00:32:40,23 --> 00:32:49,18
To learn what it is to beneath the side of a robot because you should not underestimate how different is to being cased

350
00:32:49,18 --> 00:32:55,54
in a robotic device is a complete different feeling of what you are. And since we are providing tactile feedback.

351
00:32:56,07 --> 00:33:03,47
They're getting tactile feedback from their legs inside of their stand alone robot so that takes several months of

352
00:33:04,33 --> 00:33:06,93
feeling that is normal.

353
00:33:07,02 --> 00:33:16,47
So then we have our intermediate step where they go instanced in this system that we call zero gravity was zero G.

354
00:33:16,47 --> 00:33:23,74
Where they're up right without a robot and they're practicing with just to be upright in

355
00:33:23,74 --> 00:33:28,19
and trying to move with some ortho's is that we fabricate

356
00:33:28,19 --> 00:33:32,26
and we give to them to practice because they're going to be in a hag's a skeleton.

357
00:33:33,16 --> 00:33:39,86
We have another step that is just a mix of virtual reality and a stand alone robot

358
00:33:39,86 --> 00:33:44,4
and finally they get into there is a skeleton just at the end of the process

359
00:33:45,49 --> 00:33:48,22
and it takes in a few months for them to get to the point

360
00:33:48,22 --> 00:33:56,43
and in the eggs are scared of them they now are using everything they learned in the previous steps to can use the

361
00:33:56,43 --> 00:34:00,5
brain activity to control to trigger the movements are there is. Skeleton.

362
00:34:00,69 --> 00:34:07,1
Now they can treat individual legs and they're getting the feedback from the feet as they walk on the ground.

363
00:34:07,37 --> 00:34:14,34
And sometimes they walk on the ground just looking in a mirror to see their bodies walking upright because that helps

364
00:34:15,06 --> 00:34:17,24
shape the brain's image of the body.

365
00:34:17,29 --> 00:34:24,73
Sometimes they have gumbos because they're walking a virtual reality environment even though they're in exist Kelton

366
00:34:24,73 --> 00:34:30,24
and sometimes they were just walking in a doing about fifty some steps back

367
00:34:30,24 --> 00:34:34,95
and forth in these laboratories basically very by thinking Oh yes.

368
00:34:37,00 --> 00:34:43,07
And that's exactly what we did this is the third prototype that we have there the first prototype was used during the

369
00:34:43,07 --> 00:34:47,45
demo of the World Cup. But of course we had to struggle with Fifa.

370
00:34:47,91 --> 00:34:52,2
You know because she for never gave us the conditions to actually do what we wanted in our

371
00:34:52,2 --> 00:34:58,2
and I don't need to go into the details but from a three minute demo we're down to twenty nine seconds and

372
00:34:58,2 --> 00:35:03,27
and which is almost literally impossible to do a robotic demonstration but it was important

373
00:35:03,27 --> 00:35:10,29
and that is the Juliano pin to the guy who actually deliver the opening kick of the World Cup He trained on the pitch

374
00:35:10,29 --> 00:35:14,89
on the grass for days and he delivered fifty seven kicks.

375
00:35:15,53 --> 00:35:24,27
In his extra index a skeleton he had fifty seven attempts and he got fifty six correct. Which show you know there.

376
00:35:24,31 --> 00:35:25,57
We are in the right direction.

377
00:35:25,6 --> 00:35:33,28
The people can get used to these devices and they can actually start performing at a very high level of accuracy.

378
00:35:33,29 --> 00:35:37,15
And of course we just started slow just with walking straight.

379
00:35:37,83 --> 00:35:46,27
Now we're going to think about we are already planing turns and all other movements the patients want to have

380
00:35:46,27 --> 00:35:48,18
but we are learning very quickly now.

381
00:35:48,23 --> 00:35:55,12
So the beginning was very difficult because some of these patients that you saw were in a wheelchair for a decade with

382
00:35:55,13 --> 00:35:59,77
no hope of nothing and and I can show you some of the movies that they haven't.

383
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:02,51
Their movements that they can make now you would be shocked.

384
00:36:02,8 --> 00:36:05,05
What a paralyzed by rigor

385
00:36:05,76 --> 00:36:11,32
and no no I'm talking about their own movement movements without the actual When you put them up. Now it is your A G.

386
00:36:11,32 --> 00:36:15,82
Again. And you in the beginning you put them up and say move and nothing would happen.

387
00:36:16,07 --> 00:36:18,23
They would stand and nothing would happen out.

388
00:36:18,29 --> 00:36:25,95
You put them here in some of these patients can actually you see them doing this with their legs suggesting that we

389
00:36:25,95 --> 00:36:29,02
reconnected. The brain to the spinal cord.

390
00:36:29,3 --> 00:36:32,08
You know they're not reconnected and atomically

391
00:36:32,08 --> 00:36:39,35
and atomically there were some nerves The survive there probably we reconnect to the functionally the brain can send a

392
00:36:39,35 --> 00:36:42,88
message in the messages get into the muscles of our.

393
00:36:42,9 --> 00:36:55,24
We look outside the line to the world really like where are you room it realize we're knowledge of your love for right.

394
00:36:56,15 --> 00:37:00,68
Software how easy I want this is something that happened in the last five years

395
00:37:00,68 --> 00:37:08,35
or so you know what I thought you know that my six years my study of neuroscience was too limited to what most there

396
00:37:08,35 --> 00:37:14,33
are scientists do electrical signals of the brain competition our strategy is and behavior

397
00:37:14,33 --> 00:37:21,53
and then I start thinking deeply with you know the help of my good friend run ups a career with a retired mathematician

398
00:37:21,53 --> 00:37:27,12
and our flaws frames whistlin and I just came to a realization one day in Montreal what I

399
00:37:27,12 --> 00:37:34,84
when I visit him why we do our work together and saying walking there. Actually when we talk about the brain.

400
00:37:35,9 --> 00:37:39,96
We should not be limited to the kind of their physiological or a tonic whole

401
00:37:39,96 --> 00:37:47,67
or neural lingo the nearest scientists talk about suddenly realize that the brain is the center of the human cosmology.

402
00:37:48,18 --> 00:37:50,64
The brain is the crew true Creator of everything.

403
00:37:51,85 --> 00:37:59,79
And I start to think about the whole universe as just raw information. Like a empty canvas.

404
00:38:00,38 --> 00:38:03,85
And the brain has the true painter the human brain.

405
00:38:04,3 --> 00:38:06,22
So I don't know if there are other brains out there

406
00:38:06,22 --> 00:38:13,98
but everything that we have the history of the planet the history of the cosmos the history of the human race.

407
00:38:15,22 --> 00:38:23,54
The jury of evolution everything that we we have conceived since the first human came out of the trees in the star

408
00:38:23,54 --> 00:38:27,00
walking. If you could somehow some.

409
00:38:27,14 --> 00:38:34,87
The amount of information knowledge process by every single human brain that every existed or exist or will exist.

410
00:38:35,84 --> 00:38:43,34
That's the universe. That's the human universe. And I start thinking about it as changing viewpoint.

411
00:38:43,52 --> 00:38:48,02
So first we thought of the earth was the center of the universe then we thought it was the sun.

412
00:38:48,48 --> 00:38:55,12
And then we started was the Milky Way But then we thought another center universe is the big bang where everything came

413
00:38:55,12 --> 00:38:57,84
of course there was something like The Big Bang. That must have been.

414
00:38:58,39 --> 00:39:05,17
I actually start thinking that the center universe at least for our IF reference is our mind is the human brain.

415
00:39:05,59 --> 00:39:11,01
And I start thinking about everything around us as information as raw information

416
00:39:12,04 --> 00:39:18,11
and information that to get any meaning to get any any description needs a brain

417
00:39:18,11 --> 00:39:21,21
and he so happens that the only one that we know is the human brain.

418
00:39:21,85 --> 00:39:30,16
So I have a direct to experiment with run on the if some wonderful life form intelligent life form would come in

419
00:39:30,16 --> 00:39:37,37
contact with us and we actually could talk to or communicate somehow. Their life form.

420
00:39:37,42 --> 00:39:43,24
Assuming he had a brain that evolved to complete different laws of evolution in a different environment.

421
00:39:43,25 --> 00:39:49,19
With There was a story of the cosmos. That is none of society ours.

422
00:39:49,21 --> 00:39:53,83
And a completely different cosmology would be confronted with ours.

423
00:39:53,85 --> 00:39:59,47
So I actually think the nearest sayas in this century may give us a hope to bring.

424
00:40:00,00 --> 00:40:02,91
Humanity the human condition to the center of our lives.

425
00:40:03,53 --> 00:40:05,56
In a position money or position

426
00:40:05,56 --> 00:40:13,75
but to balance another movement that exists in the world right now there seems to say that technology may be able to

427
00:40:13,75 --> 00:40:14,31
solve everything.

428
00:40:14,56 --> 00:40:23,21
Their technology may be able to educate our kids take care of the elderly run our airports run our universities run our

429
00:40:23,21 --> 00:40:31,57
knowledge gathering and eventually have you know some loonies say me replace us and I think this is crazy.

430
00:40:31,67 --> 00:40:32,55
This is insane.

431
00:40:32,77 --> 00:40:40,79
Technology is a projection of a much more complex thing called the brain when we create a machine like this

432
00:40:40,79 --> 00:40:45,93
or a creator a car a plane. A computer or a robot.

433
00:40:45,97 --> 00:40:51,05
We are just projecting our abstraction to our attention though device.

434
00:40:51,34 --> 00:40:56,24
There is infinity of Lee less complicated than the Creator.

435
00:40:56,27 --> 00:41:01,27
So the Creator is the mind and the human mind and that's reason I started thinking

436
00:41:02,2 --> 00:41:05,66
and I must talk about philosophy I'm not a philosopher and know nothing about philosophy.

437
00:41:06,5 --> 00:41:10,48
I'm talking about as a neuroscientist trying to use what I know about the brain.

438
00:41:10,84 --> 00:41:16,98
To actually say that the brain has a point of view. The brain is not a passive decoder of the environment.

439
00:41:17,36 --> 00:41:23,54
The brain shaped through evolution was shaped evolution by the environment by our genes by motivations

440
00:41:23,54 --> 00:41:31,59
and everything but as we are born in we grow in the early phases of our lives we study Vella P.

441
00:41:31,59 --> 00:41:38,85
A model of reality in an interpretation of reality in which the painting is an empty canvas.

442
00:41:38,87 --> 00:41:45,17
And we we give them meaning to it and we create a story and we create history too.

443
00:41:45,65 --> 00:41:51,1
You know and that's a much more profound in my opinion view of the brain

444
00:41:51,1 --> 00:41:54,47
and the whole role of neuroscience then we're told before.

445
00:41:55,02 --> 00:41:59,9
Any changes I think the balance if we believe in this the human can do.

446
00:42:00,00 --> 00:42:07,95
And becomes a much more precious much more you know what I think the Life becomes much more precious than we thought

447
00:42:07,95 --> 00:42:16,42
before because the epic of a single life. First of all cannot be reproduced ever. And it would never happen again.

448
00:42:17,55 --> 00:42:20,14
It's like a book that will never be written again.

449
00:42:20,61 --> 00:42:27,46
And I think it gives us a little more recognition as human beings then.

450
00:42:27,55 --> 00:42:34,13
Currently they see the go the world going on in up and if I can just to finish that if you read the Eliade

451
00:42:34,13 --> 00:42:40,73
or the Odyssey. Which I consider the pinnacle of human condition.

452
00:42:40,77 --> 00:42:48,85
You know a description of the human condition when a soldier or a Greek soldier would die in Troy in a battle. Homer.

453
00:42:49,97 --> 00:42:54,02
Describes who he was who are their parents who are the children to his living.

454
00:42:54,07 --> 00:43:02,09
What is the whole history of that individual there will never be recovered so so compared that to the news of a death

455
00:43:02,09 --> 00:43:13,77
in a newspaper today which is just a number. Nothing. Homer. You know God forbid three thousand years ago knew better.

456
00:43:13,84 --> 00:43:17,42
What the human condition is than we probably know now we're losing that

457
00:43:17,42 --> 00:43:23,53
and I think the process of losing it is part of our brains.

458
00:43:23,55 --> 00:43:26,1
Thinking there is a really nice and good

459
00:43:26,1 --> 00:43:32,82
and is worth it to mimic computers instead of maintaining our integrity our human condition integrity.

460
00:43:33,2 --> 00:43:47,95
So for your scientific view. With sorrow. Yes we're our unique this now in terms of the way we look at the brain.

461
00:43:47,97 --> 00:43:50,99
No no I think there are many people you know any people there.

462
00:43:51,64 --> 00:43:59,2
Of course there are no one says you know is a is a big field than the brain is very complicated and the subtleties.

463
00:44:00,00 --> 00:44:03,7
From a you know near physiological point of view and in up.

464
00:44:03,97 --> 00:44:09,44
For instance people believe there do we should go deeper into the molecular structure of the brain.

465
00:44:09,57 --> 00:44:14,65
I thought I find this fine from my intellectual point of view of course studying individual snaps

466
00:44:14,65 --> 00:44:18,77
and I think I just don't think any of these will hours to explain how did the system works.

467
00:44:18,96 --> 00:44:25,75
The system is is truly non-linear and new if you put your star a star in just a molecule.

468
00:44:25,77 --> 00:44:29,53
You're not going to be able to track it back to the system it will be impossible.

469
00:44:29,6 --> 00:44:32,48
The number non-linearity that you have to face so

470
00:44:32,48 --> 00:44:39,99
but there are many people there realizing what we are discussing this now is not just the I would say honestly that is

471
00:44:39,99 --> 00:44:44,51
not a mainstream yet but neither was Operation coding thirty years ago

472
00:44:44,51 --> 00:44:51,29
when I started there are people gave me no hope of having a career in study populations of neurons

473
00:44:52,09 --> 00:44:55,12
and here I am in OUR So I'm I'm used to.

474
00:44:55,15 --> 00:44:58,91
The idea that you may start with notions and concepts they're not mainstream

475
00:44:59,78 --> 00:45:01,69
and you need to demonstrate that they're worth.

476
00:45:01,79 --> 00:45:06,8
That's part of what science is about the problem is science has become extremely conservative.

477
00:45:06,82 --> 00:45:12,19
And is very difficult to break through when the idea is much more difficult than when I started when I was a kid

478
00:45:13,55 --> 00:45:15,82
but you know we're stubborn. Yeah.

479
00:45:16,15 --> 00:45:23,33
You know where you're VERY of your original work started five years in your future recently if you.

480
00:45:23,68 --> 00:45:25,36
Well I think as you can see year.

481
00:45:25,62 --> 00:45:29,97
This is going very quickly to clean a couple occasions I think are going to grow tremendously.

482
00:45:31,34 --> 00:45:38,41
I think the basic science is going to evolve in the sense that we are going to see I mean we are celebrating the curve

483
00:45:38,41 --> 00:45:44,27
of the number of neurons that we can record simultaneously. Used to be a very flat straight line.

484
00:45:44,32 --> 00:45:47,92
It took us thirty years to get to a thousand two thousand

485
00:45:47,92 --> 00:45:57,87
but now things are celery because we're learning better ways to do this my ambition to the end of my life is to be able

486
00:45:57,87 --> 00:45:59,45
to actually formally.

487
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:07,82
This theory of of you know a comprehensive theory of the mind of the brain the way we are we talked just a minute ago.

488
00:46:08,46 --> 00:46:10,98
And that's what I'm doing right now I'm spending a lot of time writing

489
00:46:11,86 --> 00:46:15,95
and reading you know I'm I'm reading literature on communication

490
00:46:15,95 --> 00:46:20,73
and Marshall McCullough Francis I became fascinated by what he used to say in the sixties

491
00:46:20,73 --> 00:46:29,2
and seventies about the media been the message and how you know the communication has changed our nature

492
00:46:29,2 --> 00:46:39,47
and from the moving from the oral tradition of poetry of the Greeks to written manuscripts then to the print to the

493
00:46:39,47 --> 00:46:45,86
radio telegraph telegraph to radio T.V. Internet. I think they're actually he got it.

494
00:46:46,07 --> 00:46:47,66
He didn't know anything about the brain.

495
00:46:48,11 --> 00:46:56,94
But some of his writings in the sixties and seventies actually God how relevant communication is to synchronize brains.

496
00:46:57,41 --> 00:46:59,55
And Arizona.

497
00:46:59,57 --> 00:47:04,74
The human brain and it's going to be very well what we're doing

498
00:47:05,6 --> 00:47:08,36
and I as a clinic up location that's what we're doing right now

499
00:47:08,36 --> 00:47:15,31
and I want to see how that goes first I want to see if these are vintages to the patients because there's a very

500
00:47:15,31 --> 00:47:18,34
concrete and tangible problem. To improve train.

501
00:47:18,77 --> 00:47:24,79
But you can if suppose you have had to have a physical patient a patient there suffer a stroke that destroyed the left

502
00:47:24,79 --> 00:47:30,22
side of the brain the cortex and he cannot talk but the right hemisphere is or is there

503
00:47:30,22 --> 00:47:34,13
and there is some language capability left to live right hemisphere.

504
00:47:34,15 --> 00:47:37,86
So pose you can connect this guy or someone else who can speak.

505
00:47:38,45 --> 00:47:46,65
And you can synthesize a voice by having a brain at work with the stroke patient maybe you can improve the training of

506
00:47:46,65 --> 00:47:53,81
the right hemisphere by persisted because we know it happens even in a drought patient if you don't have any lesion on

507
00:47:53,81 --> 00:48:00,64
this side of justice you maybe try to improve the language skills. Of the right hemisphere.

508
00:48:01,00 --> 00:48:08,67
So there's another thing that I want to start on because there's ten times more stroke victims in the world day

509
00:48:08,67 --> 00:48:16,18
and spinal cord injury victims. So we're talking about a quarter of a billion people in the world with a stroke.

510
00:48:18,38 --> 00:48:21,85
Consequents you know. So from where you develop your dream.

511
00:48:22,21 --> 00:48:29,08
Where you can see more and more parking brake growth there but for some of these drug runners.

512
00:48:29,17 --> 00:48:36,64
It's almost that you can react very you're by somebody else is active either by combining their brain

513
00:48:36,64 --> 00:48:43,48
or someone I suppose your or your sibling in our your wife or your daughter or your son to help you in the training

514
00:48:44,33 --> 00:48:50,79
and eventually it becomes a surrogate you know you can talk through this combination where you can communicate because

515
00:48:50,79 --> 00:48:55,9
there are lots of patients also. They've become totally detached from the world.

516
00:48:55,91 --> 00:49:00,95
They are cautious their brains are working to so they be absolutely conscious but for S.S.

517
00:49:00,95 --> 00:49:07,61
All the muscles look areas disease of a left all the muscles of the body are part of life. So they cannot blink.

518
00:49:07,8 --> 00:49:11,82
They cannot talk. They cannot breathe but they are cautious and their brain is fine.

519
00:49:12,03 --> 00:49:17,07
The central part of the brain is totally fine. And these patients can barely communicate.

520
00:49:18,12 --> 00:49:24,07
There is a brain machine interface for those patients that my friend had in Germany to bring in the news be bomber

521
00:49:24,07 --> 00:49:28,45
created by the same time that we are doing experiments with rats we didn't even know each other that time.

522
00:49:29,62 --> 00:49:37,58
That works but is phenomenal in news is a hero for this community but it can be improved and things can be better

523
00:49:37,58 --> 00:49:48,05
and faster. So I think that's where we can go. And the more you can bring it to you for free to tradition.

524
00:49:48,08 --> 00:49:48,88
Yeah

525
00:49:48,88 --> 00:49:55,42
and that's that's one of my concerns that computers are not creative computers don't generate knowledge we do we get

526
00:49:55,42 --> 00:49:59,75
right information and combine in ways that cannot be predicted. You know and that's reason I.

527
00:50:00,00 --> 00:50:03,52
As we've talked before I like painting because painters.

528
00:50:04,62 --> 00:50:10,7
I loved when they asked because so what the painting meant one of the two the paintings that he had of that day

529
00:50:11,42 --> 00:50:18,97
and because I said well if I knew I would not have painted in his this is it this is deeper than Probably he meant for

530
00:50:18,97 --> 00:50:20,68
me is and there are sites because it's true.

531
00:50:20,73 --> 00:50:28,51
I think it's a says painting is more of an analog description of what we're thinking about what we're feeling this is a

532
00:50:28,51 --> 00:50:37,36
projection to the outside world of some internal state of the mind and that's why I think this transition.

533
00:50:38,57 --> 00:50:44,26
That we discuss are the Impressionists and in modern art. It was an explosion of form form disappeared.

534
00:50:44,46 --> 00:50:52,79
You know why would the old guys they need to be very careful about reproducing every corner every shadow of a scene of

535
00:50:52,79 --> 00:51:00,57
a person or you know modern art remove the concept of shape from painting and sculpture in.

536
00:51:00,9 --> 00:51:02,56
Because it didn't matter anymore.

537
00:51:02,91 --> 00:51:06,61
There was a next a complete different expressions who really is in

538
00:51:06,61 --> 00:51:14,14
or could be isn't this is this is totally linked to the mind view of the brain in the face of trying to project what is

539
00:51:14,14 --> 00:51:22,63
inside rather than taking a shot of what is out there in photography of course. Got this guy's out of business.

540
00:51:22,88 --> 00:51:31,29
The guys who painted everything very in are just poor amateurs like to stew paint this thing but art.

541
00:51:31,88 --> 00:51:38,83
You talk about creativity art and my concern is that if we become just computers part would disappear.

542
00:51:39,00 --> 00:51:45,19
Computers don't do art the try to mimic they can compose artificial music that can do some taxed

543
00:51:45,19 --> 00:51:52,37
but they don't carry the human condition in those letters and those brushes you know we do

544
00:51:53,2 --> 00:51:59,4
and I feared complete with total allegiance and reliance on technology.

545
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:07,24
They destroy the human capability of being creative of doing art of doing the unexpected. You know.

546
00:52:07,75 --> 00:52:17,93
And the other cultures where brands were star. Well when you saw our soccer fans and stadium and I think there.

547
00:52:18,00 --> 00:52:23,66
I am I created this this is the metaphor in this operational definition of an organic computer.

548
00:52:23,82 --> 00:52:32,00
We're going to computers basically multiple brains that get synchronizing nature by whatever signal visual tactile

549
00:52:32,00 --> 00:52:34,93
auditory then makes them operate as a whole.

550
00:52:35,77 --> 00:52:38,74
So the flock of birds is my best and a metaphor

551
00:52:39,53 --> 00:52:48,4
or a school fish the flock if you look at the flock is very interesting because you're minimizing the chances of each

552
00:52:48,4 --> 00:52:54,97
individual to be attacked by a predator. But you know do the birds change position in the flock.

553
00:52:55,05 --> 00:52:58,9
Sometimes they have to go to the front and break the air they get tired.

554
00:52:59,11 --> 00:53:05,52
They're moved to the internal center of the flock where they are most protected because they're tired

555
00:53:05,52 --> 00:53:10,00
and by their birth they have to fly on the edge and at the edge.

556
00:53:10,02 --> 00:53:13,36
They're more vulnerable but they are always rotating so the reasoning.

557
00:53:13,45 --> 00:53:19,11
There's dynamics in this thing that is seems to be minimizing the chances of being caught.

558
00:53:19,63 --> 00:53:24,88
If you're flying by yourself. Falcon may get you. You know eagle may get you much easier.

559
00:53:25,17 --> 00:53:30,77
And as a flock the they are going to get to a source of food and they may get there.

560
00:53:30,78 --> 00:53:43,78
Easier than just the individual birds looking you know. Saw birds and fish have memory like we do hear about.

561
00:53:43,79 --> 00:53:49,86
Well one time is a complete different thing is a parallel track of my life and how that is starting to thousand

562
00:53:49,86 --> 00:53:54,78
and two and a thousand. We're going to Thousand trailing President when I was elected here in Brazil.

563
00:53:54,94 --> 00:53:58,56
I was already for a long time in the United States.

564
00:54:00,00 --> 00:54:05,53
Fourteen years already and states and I saw the opportunity to actually return to Brazil

565
00:54:05,53 --> 00:54:13,31
and do something not just to do science in Brazil was to use science as a complete different thing as an agent of

566
00:54:13,31 --> 00:54:21,07
social development in part of Brazil that is well known for Brazilians as being the most underdeveloped part of the

567
00:54:21,07 --> 00:54:26,4
country in the northeast of the country. And I wanted to prove dead human talent is everywhere.

568
00:54:27,25 --> 00:54:32,72
Then you can go and just you know drop from power shoot in and in a place

569
00:54:33,56 --> 00:54:35,58
and you start creating scientific infrastructure

570
00:54:35,58 --> 00:54:41,89
and investing high level cation in a way that will transform this social reality of the community.

571
00:54:41,89 --> 00:54:50,01
So I chose as meltdown in the outskirts of the capital on the humility to march estate and accept as not tell.

572
00:54:50,02 --> 00:54:57,84
By the goodness it is actually mean is the name of a palm tree that is typical of the regime many had sixty five

573
00:54:57,84 --> 00:55:04,74
inhabitants in the worst no human development index is in the state of

574
00:55:04,74 --> 00:55:07,12
or going to the Marquis in one of the worst in the country.

575
00:55:07,61 --> 00:55:09,41
And when we did was to go there

576
00:55:09,41 --> 00:55:17,51
and create an parallel to a new state to do their science like a nice to do it to use the knowledge that we have is

577
00:55:17,51 --> 00:55:24,79
there a scientist to design a education program that actually starts on the pre-made oh care of the mothers of our

578
00:55:24,79 --> 00:55:25,82
future students.

579
00:55:26,04 --> 00:55:34,38
So we because a human mortality or women mortality rate was very high but you get pregnant women mortality rate.

580
00:55:34,7 --> 00:55:38,97
So at that time about ninety women per hundred thousand livres would die.

581
00:55:39,45 --> 00:55:49,47
So very hyper thirty twenty thirty times higher than the you know you know you should have normally we create a clinic

582
00:55:49,48 --> 00:55:59,86
and women's clinic to oversee the prenatal care of all the women in the region and to give an idea. We start from up.

583
00:56:00,00 --> 00:56:00,74
Now we are doing.

584
00:56:00,8 --> 00:56:02,71
Twelve thousand appointments a year

585
00:56:02,71 --> 00:56:08,76
and we have been already sixty thousand appointments since we started which is which means that pretty much every woman

586
00:56:09,85 --> 00:56:15,95
in this city that got pregnant in the last six seven years have gone through our prenatal care system is all free of

587
00:56:15,95 --> 00:56:17,06
charge so public

588
00:56:17,06 --> 00:56:24,77
and is the best prenatal care you can get the medicine can offer because there are scientists we knew then if you don't

589
00:56:25,93 --> 00:56:33,85
provide the best possible prenatal care any problems then a child will have doing pregnancy can all be fixed is very

590
00:56:33,85 --> 00:56:38,63
difficult almost impossible right now and in learning disability or any other malformation of the brain.

591
00:56:38,76 --> 00:56:40,33
It will be corrected.

592
00:56:40,36 --> 00:56:43,7
So how could you have a neuro science maze of the cation program

593
00:56:43,7 --> 00:56:53,56
and offer these A students a chance to be born with the highest possible biological potential to achieve happiness

594
00:56:53,56 --> 00:56:56,89
because that's my definition of integration is a pathway to happiness.

595
00:56:57,58 --> 00:57:04,19
So we can in these indication program that it starts in the Premier Care in then we start rolling fifteen hundred kids

596
00:57:04,19 --> 00:57:08,32
a year to three schools that we created too in that state

597
00:57:08,32 --> 00:57:14,84
and one in another state in by year where the kids go in one part of the day to public school.

598
00:57:15,45 --> 00:57:19,05
Which in Brazil is now full time and is just four or five hours a day

599
00:57:19,83 --> 00:57:26,48
but on the all appear the day they would come to our schools in our schools in Micah even at how any second name by ear

600
00:57:26,48 --> 00:57:28,68
all lab science oriented.

601
00:57:29,36 --> 00:57:36,68
Even to learn Portuguese you learn in a lab and we basically make these guys this is students from that time from

602
00:57:36,68 --> 00:57:39,93
and ten to fifteen years old and

603
00:57:39,93 --> 00:57:44,11
when we open our new school in the campus of the brain that we're beauty one hundred get there.

604
00:57:44,16 --> 00:57:52,09
Scampers in that region is taking a seven years to finish that the school is going to be from zero to seventeen.

605
00:57:53,02 --> 00:57:59,86
So from the moment them born till then they can go to the nursery. To the moment they finish high school they're going.

606
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:03,54
To be in our school if they want about three thousand kids total

607
00:58:04,24 --> 00:58:09,84
and then we are going to have a undergrad program in the campus for kids that want to pursue a scientific career

608
00:58:10,66 --> 00:58:14,52
and master's in post-doctoral training.

609
00:58:14,56 --> 00:58:18,7
So we're going to have a program that means that a kid can be there for thirty years. If they want.

610
00:58:18,87 --> 00:58:25,78
Money in the case of these science education program that we created on day opposite period of the day from public

611
00:58:25,78 --> 00:58:26,08
school.

612
00:58:27,27 --> 00:58:34,84
These kids became protagonists in their own indication they basically got involved in learning as a as a pleasant

613
00:58:34,84 --> 00:58:38,96
experience for and they develop antics of learning.

614
00:58:39,04 --> 00:58:45,3
Then we never saw in their region in most parts of Brazil because they don't go to our schools because they have to go

615
00:58:45,3 --> 00:58:49,81
because they want to and then school became a school not only for science

616
00:58:49,81 --> 00:58:57,92
but for developing citizens says they're fully aware of their rights fully aware of their responsibilities in society

617
00:58:57,92 --> 00:59:04,61
in fully aware this science and knowledge can be to passports for their happiness for India further education

618
00:59:05,7 --> 00:59:11,76
and multiply to a point then we have already eleven thousand kids that have gone through is a school system

619
00:59:11,76 --> 00:59:18,2
and for the first time in their place history in the neighborhoods next to it.

620
00:59:18,34 --> 00:59:22,35
These kids and gaining access to the best universities in Brazil.

621
00:59:22,37 --> 00:59:27,76
And in that region public universities where they could never make it because they never could past admissions exam.

622
00:59:27,99 --> 00:59:31,37
Even though our schools will have exams. We don't do tests.

623
00:59:31,45 --> 00:59:38,03
We don't believe in past so we don't believe in the Anglo-Saxon Punit if way of teaching we believe in to finish way we

624
00:59:38,03 --> 00:59:45,31
don't we have replicated the Finnish approach to education in Brazil without knowing until very recently that we were

625
00:59:45,31 --> 00:59:53,78
very soon a parallels with one caveat that the Finnish and not learn yet we do the Duke Asian since the prenatal care.

626
00:59:53,8 --> 00:59:59,94
So in now the women our partners to in on that we created a community there.

627
01:00:00,00 --> 01:00:04,11
He's very supportive of everything we do because different from most universities in the world.

628
01:00:04,36 --> 01:00:08,00
There really are these beautiful paradises of knowledge

629
01:00:08,00 --> 01:00:11,83
but this rounding parts of the university have nothing to do the university

630
01:00:11,83 --> 01:00:14,00
and have no idea what is going on inside the doors.

631
01:00:14,04 --> 01:00:16,68
I see that particularly in our own United States

632
01:00:16,68 --> 01:00:26,09
and even here in Brazil we create a campus there has no walls is totally opposed to the community in the community has

633
01:00:26,09 --> 01:00:33,21
learned to value of science because science is not for papers books publications in that position knowledge science in

634
01:00:33,21 --> 01:00:38,61
that how in my cable we demonstrated science can also be an agent of social and economic transformation.

635
01:00:39,12 --> 01:00:45,56
Because in addition to promoting education and women's health. We have created a whole cascade of jobs.

636
01:00:46,05 --> 01:00:54,08
And I hire production line of support. Suppliers people to make. Construction work because we have beauty and campus.

637
01:00:54,31 --> 01:00:59,71
So it's very nice to see the funders of our children building this campus.

638
01:00:59,84 --> 01:01:03,16
They they work for the construction company that has built

639
01:01:03,16 --> 01:01:08,4
and the first two beauties of the ninja game to get to that twelve thousand square meter

640
01:01:08,4 --> 01:01:16,47
and the research institute in the India twelve thousand square meter school.

641
01:01:24,41 --> 01:01:33,94
Oh I know my new book about the Natalee my cut my cable project is how to beat zero topia a scientific social topia

642
01:01:33,94 --> 01:01:39,31
because you know in our days of top it has become almost like a curse word a negative word

643
01:01:39,31 --> 01:01:46,12
and I disagree frontally with that I think that we have to have a pope is in dreams even if we don't fulfill them

644
01:01:46,12 --> 01:01:53,13
completely is very important to be gauging one because of the process makes us want to get out a house or a house

645
01:01:53,13 --> 01:02:00,96
and go out here in this pretty tough cruel world and naturally do something concrete. And in that pile.

646
01:02:01,78 --> 01:02:07,81
I think that's what happened and we had Brazilians coming from all over the country teachers scientists

647
01:02:07,81 --> 01:02:14,35
and physicians and the strangers technicians and who believed in these Autopia

648
01:02:14,35 --> 01:02:19,32
and now they can put their hands on these walls and we can see these kids getting to the university

649
01:02:19,32 --> 01:02:27,08
and so is a very rewarding experience effect is one of the things that when I go to the power

650
01:02:27,08 --> 01:02:29,38
and all I feel the real me of science.

651
01:02:29,87 --> 01:02:35,95
And when I look at here and dissipate sions and I go to that how I actually feel it was worth it.

652
01:02:36,2 --> 01:02:41,72
You know this thirty five years of work. Oh absolutely.

653
01:02:42,15 --> 01:02:43,88
We need dreamy for a variety of reasons

654
01:02:43,88 --> 01:02:50,65
but a neuroscientist Yes I think if you if you equate as a reason discussed before if we equate narrow science

655
01:02:50,65 --> 01:02:55,64
or any science just with technology of element. You're missing the most important part of it is the.

656
01:02:56,1 --> 01:03:03,47
Dream is this creativity is trying to answer questions and nobody has ever asked or nobody ever had an answer for

657
01:03:03,47 --> 01:03:06,77
and so the first time to John shape it and I recorded.

658
01:03:07,28 --> 01:03:12,1
Twenty six there no simultaneously in that little rant in our labs in the middle of the night.

659
01:03:12,48 --> 01:03:13,42
First get to me

660
01:03:13,42 --> 01:03:19,11
and then there was a good thing we could share a lawyer for divorces because in a weird five in the morning recording a

661
01:03:19,11 --> 01:03:23,13
red brain. In our lifes will never believe that we're actually doing it.

662
01:03:23,41 --> 01:03:30,11
By the second thing we thought both of us in Philadelphia in ninety one was this is going to change everything.

663
01:03:31,33 --> 01:03:32,00
Nobody knew

664
01:03:32,00 --> 01:03:39,27
but we knew we were different ones to see those twenty six limbs find together in me some little one for us.

665
01:03:39,71 --> 01:03:42,63
That was the universe. You know that was the thing that changed our lives.

666
01:03:43,03 --> 01:03:55,61
You know if it's well yeah I think his guys live in a bubble.

667
01:03:55,74 --> 01:03:59,95
You know they're very interesting things they have created and they're very interesting as they have.

668
01:04:00,00 --> 01:04:03,79
Changed the world that have created but they're not the gods of the universe.

669
01:04:04,08 --> 01:04:08,44
They think they are in there a lot of home race and arrogance there too.

670
01:04:08,45 --> 01:04:15,2
And there's a very a lot of talented people and I want to very gifted people interested to go to San Francisco

671
01:04:16,23 --> 01:04:21,52
and I asked opinions of people who live in San Francisco before this thing exploded Silicon Valley

672
01:04:21,52 --> 01:04:27,19
and what is going on there because a lot of people there believe that technology will solve all our problems

673
01:04:27,19 --> 01:04:34,38
and that's not through our problems will be solved by the good old fashion way of humans interacting

674
01:04:34,38 --> 01:04:40,18
and trying to find a consensus to live together through democracy to to gauge

675
01:04:40,18 --> 01:04:44,41
when to social engagement to recognizing that not everybody is born.

676
01:04:44,52 --> 01:04:46,87
And disabled Bertone it is

677
01:04:46,87 --> 01:04:54,66
and we need to increase the opportunities to everybody in trying to look for a way to so everybody can see happen is an

678
01:04:54,66 --> 01:04:59,37
achievement and a good amount of it and then perhaps everything that good amount of good that is

679
01:04:59,37 --> 01:05:03,32
and makes life decent for everybody

680
01:05:03,32 --> 01:05:08,31
and to believe that they were willing to solve all the problems of the universe through Facebook or Twitter

681
01:05:08,31 --> 01:05:09,84
or to robots

682
01:05:09,84 --> 01:05:18,79
or fission talents is ludicrous is in fact in my opinion a new wave of captivity is wearing you meet the E.U.

683
01:05:18,79 --> 01:05:23,79
You have to read Jews as a human value and you have to devalue the human contribution.

684
01:05:25,24 --> 01:05:33,36
Because then if you reduce human cost of labor human creature profits to infinity as a very well known equation in you

685
01:05:33,36 --> 01:05:45,53
cannot eliminate the human value is obvious you know and but so in some senses when I'm very main science.

686
01:05:45,84 --> 01:05:51,8
Some of the prophecy is that these groups like Carswell and others have made that we are going to be replace

687
01:05:51,8 --> 01:05:59,85
and not only fullish in Basan any scientific data they're dangerous in my opinion they actually confront.

688
01:06:00,00 --> 01:06:07,14
It's really the fact there has to be an answer to that in the answer is dead. We're humans in our.

689
01:06:07,74 --> 01:06:16,65
And we most value most precious. Capabilities and not out there for additional computer to replace.

690
01:06:18,39 --> 01:06:24,34
Her problems in the directing the venue of the human species in my opinion in millions

691
01:06:24,34 --> 01:06:32,3
and millions billions of years of evolution that took us from a base of rock

692
01:06:32,31 --> 01:06:39,76
or the Stardust to a thinking creative non-conformist human brain

693
01:06:40,58 --> 01:06:56,97
and he's destroying the fabric of humanity in my opinion and so we need to be aware of it in confront as guys. Yet.

694
01:06:58,53 --> 01:07:09,07
Maybe start off the most. Is very brave. And here.

695
01:07:09,62 --> 01:07:22,85
When you when we look around all the metaphors says is if you want room with Barton. So it's not us.

696
01:07:24,34 --> 01:07:29,14
Are you saving grace so much acted out.

697
01:07:30,00 --> 01:07:37,28
Yeah well that's the difference of a technician in a scientist my professor here in Brazil which was the father of

698
01:07:37,28 --> 01:07:42,38
their science in Brazil says a Cheerio always told me there's a big difference between a technician in a scientist

699
01:07:42,38 --> 01:07:49,21
or a technician been to give those and run things like a robot a scientist thinks like a human.

700
01:07:49,23 --> 01:07:58,43
And thinks about science in Brother terms than just it a specific field or a specific area of his or her work.

701
01:07:58,53 --> 01:07:59,95
I think we said.

702
01:08:00,00 --> 01:08:06,74
Interests almost need my I didn't by default to have a very profound and deep intellectual background

703
01:08:06,74 --> 01:08:11,93
and we need to think about the consequences of what we do you know the legacy of what we do

704
01:08:11,93 --> 01:08:13,76
and the way our science is used.

705
01:08:14,8 --> 01:08:15,63
We didn't talk about this

706
01:08:15,63 --> 01:08:22,42
but there's a very new danger of weaponize in the brain in I'm totally opposed to it because this is the last frontier

707
01:08:22,42 --> 01:08:29,83
in I don't want to see what I did when I created called brain machine interfaces being used to harm or kill people.

708
01:08:30,11 --> 01:08:32,19
And so on.

709
01:08:32,35 --> 01:08:36,63
Well you can imagine this is happening now in some places

710
01:08:36,63 --> 01:08:41,71
but you know the one states where the Bundy face is thinking about using being machine interfaces to create weapons.

711
01:08:41,93 --> 01:08:44,79
You know that humans can control just by thinking.

712
01:08:44,81 --> 01:08:50,21
And I frontally opposed this and I think it is important in a scientists and speak out.

713
01:08:50,54 --> 01:09:03,64
You know against this kind of use of this research was that these three groups or all of us

714
01:09:04,95 --> 01:09:11,39
and our only hope is society because we scientists push the envelope to discover what is possible

715
01:09:11,39 --> 01:09:19,82
but is society's duty and right to regulate what can be done with this knowledge. You know around the world and.

716
01:09:19,84 --> 01:09:26,64
When you see face. Yeah.

717
01:09:26,65 --> 01:09:36,36
It's more of a show yet that what people are thinking there is totally I mean I mean he's totally for me unethical.

718
01:09:36,61 --> 01:09:40,07
You know what are well to think about

719
01:09:40,07 --> 01:09:46,11
and blame thousand soldiers with electrodes to record brain tissue that can be used to control guns or weapons

720
01:09:46,11 --> 01:09:47,04
or whatever.

721
01:09:47,2 --> 01:09:50,84
I don't know the detail because I refused to even listen to the details

722
01:09:51,62 --> 01:10:05,13
but this is a debate that has to be done among scientists and society not only among neuroscientists Yes. It's a sign.

723
01:10:05,25 --> 01:10:11,57
We now know you'll get signals from the brain to control a machine gun must miss I lunching you ice

724
01:10:11,57 --> 01:10:16,77
or God knows what I don't know or ends a skeleton for a soldier to tune into world war.

725
01:10:17,08 --> 01:10:23,36
You know that's not what I had in mind when I created this technology. This is what I had in mind. You know.

726
01:10:25,68 --> 01:10:33,71
This world. We're Great Britain.

727
01:10:33,72 --> 01:10:43,78
Yes we're how far from home while in there's a I told you I have this point I don't have I have just soo positions in

728
01:10:44,54 --> 01:10:50,14
hints in a gut feeling to describe it. I can tell you a precisely what he called the light.

729
01:10:50,31 --> 01:10:57,26
I think about as I told you but they show up locations that can be beneficial to mankind

730
01:10:57,95 --> 01:11:00,84
and to people who are suffering from disorders or diseases and

731
01:11:00,84 --> 01:11:06,85
but I don't I don't even think about so I fight scenarios that are harmful and I only want it.

732
01:11:07,77 --> 01:11:12,6
Yet while I think that if we could communicate better if we could find a way of communication.

733
01:11:12,81 --> 01:11:18,52
Then you know he's more natural and better perhaps who would figure it out that we all the same.

734
01:11:19,14 --> 01:11:21,17
That we have the same fears no matter where you come from.

735
01:11:21,39 --> 01:11:25,55
We have same aspirations they have same desires we're all humans by the way in

736
01:11:25,56 --> 01:11:34,57
and I look at you know things like the refugee crisis in Europe in perhaps my brain to brain communicating would

737
01:11:34,57 --> 01:11:42,5
realize that we are all coming from the same place in and by the way the place was Africa. You know.

738
01:11:42,59 --> 01:11:51,13
And so racism and prejudice and prejudice based on economic differences on the nation.

739
01:11:51,28 --> 01:11:58,75
You know all of this things would disappear if we could somehow convince people that we had goes through in our brains

740
01:11:58,75 --> 01:12:08,59
is the same thing. It's the same stuff and want to bring is produced is the same in the future more and more.

741
01:12:08,61 --> 01:12:10,55
I hope it could become more

742
01:12:10,55 --> 01:12:16,26
and more liberating effect if you read Arthur Clark's three thousand one of the last book of his.

743
01:12:16,98 --> 01:12:20,75
Series that he started to Thousand and One in on it.

744
01:12:21,92 --> 01:12:28,18
He starts the book with something called Brain caps in two thousand and one in people communicate by brain caps.

745
01:12:28,45 --> 01:12:33,96
You know INTO IT TELLS I want to we're you know why he would be happy to know that we have thousand years earlier in

746
01:12:33,97 --> 01:12:35,51
getting some of this stuff to work.

747
01:12:35,71 --> 01:12:38,14
Of course what he described I don't think will ever happen but

748
01:12:38,86 --> 01:12:48,35
and what is interesting to see that neuroscience can even computer science fiction. OK.

749
01:12:48,4 --> 01:13:01,24
He didn't do much of a dark yet see we're already on I why I always want to ask Cameron where he got the idea because

750
01:13:01,24 --> 01:13:07,35
he claims he had a dream. We had published many Scientific American papers before he had that dream I think so.

751
01:13:07,38 --> 01:13:12,04
I'm always will. Wonder what he got that idea of having a guy you know was she controlling and I have a pair.

752
01:13:12,49 --> 01:13:19,89
The so because this was out there you know I would be very very curious to ask in one way he really got the idea.

753
01:13:19,9 --> 01:13:23,62
You know that's the director of the film.

754
01:13:23,64 --> 01:13:31,56
You know your camera business or technical aspect is one of the many things they're not possible.

755
01:13:31,61 --> 01:13:38,04
Of course and then he just made it up which is did vanish a science fiction to us so we can all make it up.

756
01:13:38,2 --> 01:13:45,64
Everywhere you were never what you were doing before or since you were for a moment.

757
01:13:46,12 --> 01:13:57,54
So it's sort of YOUR it's from what is special one word yet where I tell my students always imagination is always the

758
01:13:57,54 --> 01:14:00,59
limit here. You know we end. In these labs.

759
01:14:01,77 --> 01:14:10,04
We're not here to do it in the name of the incremental things we're they had to push the limit of their science.

760
01:14:12,51 --> 01:14:19,59
You know and this is what you could. Yes but of course the timescale is not tomorrow. But.

761
01:14:20,12 --> 01:14:29,28
I like to work with people that. Likes that deal. You know to do of thinking far ahead and trying to make it happen.
