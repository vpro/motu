1
00:00:00,00 --> 00:00:05,43
Yes I told you so you were in part. Right. What do you think you fifty one.

2
00:00:06,76 --> 00:00:11,08
Yeah I think I think we have a very very creative laboratory

3
00:00:11,08 --> 00:00:20,54
and I like pushing the boundaries into Muslims call disruptive or transformative technology and we have.

4
00:00:20,58 --> 00:00:22,39
You know artists in the lab

5
00:00:22,39 --> 00:00:35,62
and you know I think player would would also I think for fun you know you know science writers I mean yeah I mean.

6
00:00:35,64 --> 00:00:37,58
We don't take ourselves too seriously.

7
00:00:38,23 --> 00:00:47,54
We try to do experiments that are both imp important for something societal but they're also very playful and

8
00:00:47,54 --> 00:00:57,32
and illustrate an interesting way of looking at things is that makes people smile and surprised. Oh. Why is it.

9
00:00:57,37 --> 00:00:59,86
Why do we do that. Why do they smile.

10
00:01:00,95 --> 00:01:12,46
Well some of them were funny like making seventy billion copies of my book that more than all the most welts the

11
00:01:12,46 --> 00:01:18,14
purchase books in history and that's kind of a funny idea and the idea that the D.N.A.

12
00:01:18,14 --> 00:01:24,14
Could last for seven hundred thousand years or maybe a million years is is fun and.

13
00:01:24,16 --> 00:01:34,9
Making a woolly mammoth this for you know you can have a serious reason likes the the survival of the Asian elephant

14
00:01:34,9 --> 00:01:39,25
or but it's also very it's just makes you smile through think that the new

15
00:01:39,25 --> 00:01:55,69
and all the animal that sixteenth comes back when the borders. Yes right. Yes. You know parties are right.

16
00:01:56,53 --> 00:02:02,96
Yeah so in a way that's that's very serious in that. When we started the ten years ago.

17
00:02:02,97 --> 00:02:08,46
There were all these really scary and crazy rules.

18
00:02:08,48 --> 00:02:12,75
That didn't didn't really make sense like through that that your D.N.A.

19
00:02:12,75 --> 00:02:20,37
Would your your information medical information would never Xscape from the lab even though there are multiple examples

20
00:02:20,37 --> 00:02:22,08
like Wiki Leaks and so forth

21
00:02:22,08 --> 00:02:26,46
and then once it escaped would never be read in a fight even though it's very rich data set

22
00:02:26,46 --> 00:02:33,64
and we know we can read the fine. That if we learned something about two that could save your life.

23
00:02:33,71 --> 00:02:39,19
We couldn't tell you because we couldn't give data back to you just all all sorts of crazy things like this.

24
00:02:40,04 --> 00:02:43,58
And so we want to begin to take you know be a little more playful

25
00:02:43,58 --> 00:02:48,82
and say well what if we did just the opposite of are all of those things if they sound a little crazy.

26
00:02:49,15 --> 00:02:54,26
Let's do the opposite. Maybe it'll be either playful or or super sane.

27
00:02:54,28 --> 00:03:02,34
So the it's the it's the only project in the world now for ten years where where you can actually have free access to

28
00:03:02,35 --> 00:03:08,75
human biology genomes environments and traits. It's kind of like Wikipedia for human beings.

29
00:03:09,53 --> 00:03:14,85
So it's revolutionary and playful.

30
00:03:14,87 --> 00:03:24,09
It's a collection of big data of each individual person so it's not just it's not big because a lot of people it's big

31
00:03:24,09 --> 00:03:28,2
for each person and it's the way we think that medicine will be practiced in the future

32
00:03:28,2 --> 00:03:36,88
but we collect medical records a whole variety of measurements that we do every year on D.N.A.

33
00:03:36,88 --> 00:03:40,81
Day where the people come back every year and get an update.

34
00:03:41,81 --> 00:03:49,88
Sometimes new all sorts of new tests and then then genomic the genomic sequence

35
00:03:49,88 --> 00:03:53,49
and a number of other all mix micro biome mix

36
00:03:53,49 --> 00:03:59,18
and viral sequences the things that in your environment that can greatly influence your health.

37
00:04:00,00 --> 00:04:07,92
So the so we get this big collection and we make it publicly available so that anybody in the world can help analyze

38
00:04:07,93 --> 00:04:21,91
and and interpret and understand your genome everybody you know everybody's genome is in the project for future.

39
00:04:21,92 --> 00:04:28,28
So it's not intended to be a production project so much as an inspirational one where where we show people people said

40
00:04:28,28 --> 00:04:34,51
oh you can't do this is a you know it's just it's impossible. And we showed Well it's actually not so hard to do it.

41
00:04:34,6 --> 00:04:38,8
And so now it changes the conversation in so many of the things that we thought were crazy.

42
00:04:39,1 --> 00:04:48,11
Now people agree that maybe we should be sharing data back with the individual getting them properly educated up front.

43
00:04:50,92 --> 00:04:55,64
Admitting that we can't keep the data from getting out in any project in anywhere in the world.

44
00:04:55,84 --> 00:05:02,02
In fact even even medical records in a hospital which have nothing to do research are extremely valuable now they're

45
00:05:02,02 --> 00:05:08,25
twenty times the value of your credit card on the black market so.

46
00:05:08,26 --> 00:05:12,34
Many of these things that were told not ten years ago are now accepted.

47
00:05:12,4 --> 00:05:15,63
So I was those that was the main thing we were going for but

48
00:05:15,63 --> 00:05:19,17
but what what will happen is once once is why they accepted.

49
00:05:19,29 --> 00:05:23,81
We may eventually have seven billion people's genomes and medical records available

50
00:05:24,6 --> 00:05:38,53
and then you can find all kinds of correlations and and what causes diseases and cures you can want personalized.

51
00:05:38,55 --> 00:05:42,63
Not now not only personalized based on your D.N.A.

52
00:05:42,63 --> 00:05:48,47
but Personalized based on your environment as well and most importantly I think is prevention.

53
00:05:48,66 --> 00:05:54,7
So an awful lot of medicine is you wait until it's kind of too late. Where you've got D.N.A.

54
00:05:55,9 --> 00:06:01,71
Damage to your body or you've got cancer and. If you try to catch cancer very very early.

55
00:06:02,03 --> 00:06:04,98
It's really already too late because it's already started.

56
00:06:05,06 --> 00:06:12,61
It's got its mechanism rear revved up to to make more mutations and what do you get.

57
00:06:15,00 --> 00:06:22,86
So basically when you would explain what you were doing. Somebody could years.

58
00:06:22,88 --> 00:06:32,03
Sure we are lab develops radical technologies for reading and writing D.N.A. The same way you read and write a book.

59
00:06:32,04 --> 00:06:33,1
We can do that with D.N.A.

60
00:06:33,1 --> 00:06:44,09
and We've brought the price down by about over a million fold in the books for everybody in the last eight years

61
00:06:44,09 --> 00:06:49,75
or you know for the coming years. What do you forsee near future. Ten years.

62
00:06:50,11 --> 00:06:58,75
Right like yeah well we don't know if we can sustain this incredible exponential speed where it gets faster

63
00:06:58,75 --> 00:06:59,64
and faster every year

64
00:07:00,46 --> 00:07:10,61
but if we can in in in ten years it will be unrecognizable in terms of the technologies we can do will be able to

65
00:07:11,75 --> 00:07:15,37
change agriculture medicine.

66
00:07:15,39 --> 00:07:23,59
Forensics you name an even even information handling that you normally think is the realm of electronics will be

67
00:07:23,59 --> 00:07:44,1
molecular you know what sense is that Chris what is Chris first crisper So in a crisper is a buzz word that that really

68
00:07:44,1 --> 00:07:46,31
is capturing the imagination

69
00:07:47,72 --> 00:07:56,14
but it represents a much broader set of tools that we we've had for a few years to engineer genomes.

70
00:07:56,34 --> 00:07:59,75
So in addition to the the new ability to read genomes.

71
00:08:00,00 --> 00:08:03,43
Christer represents a way of editing genomes is not the only way

72
00:08:03,43 --> 00:08:10,37
but it's it's something that captures people's imagination and we helped invent that.

73
00:08:10,38 --> 00:08:13,25
About three years ago now and and.

74
00:08:13,77 --> 00:08:23,83
Many people have improved on about seventy people who of the labs have contributed to open research nonprofit resource

75
00:08:23,83 --> 00:08:32,9
called add gene and then redistributed them the thirty thousand laboratories. Sorry. So you know go so.

76
00:08:32,92 --> 00:08:40,72
Crisper is the latest in a series of ways of manipulating the genome where you the computer science

77
00:08:40,72 --> 00:08:47,9
and computer defined twenty base pairs eight C's G.'s and T.'s in a particular order chosen to be specific.

78
00:08:47,91 --> 00:08:53,99
For one place in your genome in your D.N.A. and Not anywhere else in your genome so it's both positive and negative.

79
00:08:54,00 --> 00:09:01,83
Computer selection and then it will cut it will search through the genome randomly and find the right place

80
00:09:01,83 --> 00:09:06,26
and make a cut both strands of the D.N.A. and Then that either.

81
00:09:06,56 --> 00:09:13,22
That eliminates the gene that it just cut in or it helps repair to whatever you want.

82
00:09:13,23 --> 00:09:18,94
So that's precise gene that is what people are so excited about where you can change it into whatever you want

83
00:09:18,94 --> 00:09:26,47
and we were the first lab to do that in human stem cells but and those can be turned into almost any cell

84
00:09:26,47 --> 00:09:31,99
and it can be done in a whole variety of different organisms and almost every organism that's been tried it works

85
00:09:31,99 --> 00:09:43,16
and because it's like like you use marketing word. X. Ray. Right right right.

86
00:09:43,41 --> 00:09:48,54
So some people call editing just making a mass breaking making a break.

87
00:09:48,55 --> 00:09:51,41
I think that's that's like that's like saying that.

88
00:09:52,04 --> 00:09:58,8
Ripping a page out of your journal is editing and it's it's not really that. But this allows a very precise editing.

89
00:10:01,5 --> 00:10:05,00
If you read. OK revise.

90
00:10:05,15 --> 00:10:15,68
All right so you can now engineer agricultural species wild species and you can do preventative medicine.

91
00:10:16,79 --> 00:10:25,71
It's not just it's not read these three groups. Is there any writing ours. Right.

92
00:10:25,91 --> 00:10:29,96
So you know it's it's a three year old technique

93
00:10:29,96 --> 00:10:37,37
but it's been growing exponentially in the number of people adopting it is huge and.

94
00:10:37,39 --> 00:10:54,44
And every new person adopts it helps also make it work better. You know. Start to create so for people with very self.

95
00:10:54,8 --> 00:11:02,11
Help those people are right. So it's particularly valuable for.

96
00:11:02,13 --> 00:11:06,64
So-called rare diseases that are individually rare but collectively there's a large number of them.

97
00:11:07,13 --> 00:11:13,63
And so you might have maybe three to five percent of the population is affected by these even though each one only

98
00:11:13,63 --> 00:11:14,68
affects one in one hundred thousand.

99
00:11:15,36 --> 00:11:23,74
Together there and and so if you have two parents that are carriers and they have no.

100
00:11:23,76 --> 00:11:29,66
They will have twenty five percent of their children will be severely affected very deterministic is you know it's not

101
00:11:29,66 --> 00:11:36,58
really probabilistic it's almost guaranteed and that means that.

102
00:11:37,36 --> 00:11:44,72
The only real way that that protects the family including you know the church so the children in the family

103
00:11:44,72 --> 00:11:50,93
or are healthy is abortion which is not acceptable to many people in the world

104
00:11:51,81 --> 00:11:58,93
and so Gene editing go see opportunity of changing the sperm so that you don't have to affect the embryos you can do it

105
00:11:58,93 --> 00:12:06,39
without hurting. Or putting him at any risk. So that's a new possibility that has has has yet to be demonstrated.

106
00:12:10,28 --> 00:12:14,39
Credible future review for developing right.

107
00:12:14,97 --> 00:12:30,82
Which right now you can reduce disease without eliminating the gene variants. Of me viruses or bacteria or. Even that.

108
00:12:31,38 --> 00:12:34,13
Right right.

109
00:12:34,26 --> 00:12:42,61
So we've made by zero containment versions of bacteria that are where are stuck in the lab they can't they have very

110
00:12:42,61 --> 00:12:43,8
low a scape rates

111
00:12:44,93 --> 00:12:50,03
and this particular important if you put things in the bacteria that would give them an advantage in the wild life for

112
00:12:50,03 --> 00:12:54,85
example virus resistant that could be very productive in an industrial setting.

113
00:12:55,21 --> 00:12:56,95
But you don't want that to get out into the wild.

114
00:12:57,03 --> 00:13:04,28
So you have to have both a viral viral anti-viral strategy and the bio containment thought together.

115
00:13:04,44 --> 00:13:10,05
That was actually done without crisper quite a bit of the genome editing in genome engineering we do in our lab does

116
00:13:10,05 --> 00:13:15,16
not evolve crisper and that's a perfect example of one which where we've done probably the most radical

117
00:13:15,16 --> 00:13:22,92
and extensive engineering of four million base pairs. Without the risk for.

118
00:13:22,94 --> 00:13:33,08
Where these these genes as you have your work source. Well I think this.

119
00:13:33,17 --> 00:13:39,36
Those are the source of our industry and enthusiasm is.

120
00:13:40,14 --> 00:13:47,77
Just knowing that you can answer very basic scientific questions at the same time you push you drive down the price of

121
00:13:47,77 --> 00:13:50,83
technology make democratizing it making available to many people

122
00:13:51,6 --> 00:13:59,54
and then the product of the applications of the technology can be even more societal impactful than the technology

123
00:13:59,54 --> 00:13:59,62
itself.

124
00:14:00,00 --> 00:14:07,61
Such as you know transplant patient solving the transplantation crisis the malaria crisis

125
00:14:07,61 --> 00:14:14,18
and aging crisis these these are all things are highly motivational for millions of people are dying every year.

126
00:14:14,46 --> 00:14:20,12
Your purse is my personal energy comes from.

127
00:14:20,14 --> 00:14:30,93
The threat that all these people are going to die every year and the curiosity if playfulness of the science that.

128
00:14:31,08 --> 00:14:37,06
So you could simultaneously play and do something very serious which is saving millions of people when you start.

129
00:14:40,15 --> 00:14:49,34
Yeah I remember when I was a boy in Florida living. On the water on them in the mud.

130
00:14:50,31 --> 00:14:57,15
I would play in the mud and I would pull the creatures out of the mud. And wonder how they worked.

131
00:14:57,77 --> 00:15:06,15
And I would look at my father's medical bag. It was full of drugs and instruments and I said that since so.

132
00:15:06,28 --> 00:15:12,11
So one was very natural and one was very artificial and I was in awe of both of them and then

133
00:15:12,11 --> 00:15:18,66
and then I went to a World's Fair in New York City from always from Florida New York City when I was ten years old

134
00:15:18,66 --> 00:15:22,9
and I and they had created a simulated future.

135
00:15:23,58 --> 00:15:31,52
They had did gone really really far out on making a pretend world where everything you know they had robots that looked

136
00:15:31,52 --> 00:15:39,26
just like a human being and I said. And then I From that day at I could not I could never go back to the past.

137
00:15:39,36 --> 00:15:42,86
You know even though they didn't have a real future it was a fake future.

138
00:15:43,13 --> 00:15:46,6
I could not just anymore once I had seen the future.

139
00:15:46,64 --> 00:15:58,04
That was I had to work on it to make it happen because it seemed very attractive to us.

140
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:02,34
It's dangerous

141
00:16:02,35 --> 00:16:13,52
and very hopeful to create a fictitious future in such graphic terms where you can walk around it you can taste it.

142
00:16:13,6 --> 00:16:19,39
You can feel it you can see it you know it had touch pads in one nine hundred sixty five where you could draw something

143
00:16:19,39 --> 00:16:23,16
and then they would print out the. Whatever you Drew.

144
00:16:23,76 --> 00:16:31,77
Not on paper but in fabric you could actually make a scarf of a butterfly that would draw with with a pen.

145
00:16:31,79 --> 00:16:39,22
That's that took like forty years before there was anything even similar to that that that the average person could use

146
00:16:40,63 --> 00:16:59,46
or you would use a fair where you know surely future US for you know this right. Well I mean.

147
00:16:59,48 --> 00:17:03,05
To some extent it doesn't have to be entirely accurate.

148
00:17:04,1 --> 00:17:07,6
Obviously it can't be she can't see the future but it just needs to be inspiring

149
00:17:07,6 --> 00:17:15,95
and to a ten year old is particularly easy to inspire. So you might see space colonies.

150
00:17:16,03 --> 00:17:19,44
I think with with humans that are adapted to space.

151
00:17:19,47 --> 00:17:24,51
You know right now our biology is particularly I mean it was not designed for space travel

152
00:17:25,61 --> 00:17:29,00
or the radiation resistance and the bone loss it happens of low gravity.

153
00:17:29,88 --> 00:17:34,48
So those might be some of that there might be you know.

154
00:17:35,05 --> 00:17:39,17
Either conquering our micro biome completely eliminating it

155
00:17:39,17 --> 00:17:45,00
or getting the point where where we are resistant to everything else and so we didn't eliminate it.

156
00:17:45,01 --> 00:17:47,85
We just got better at at vaccination

157
00:17:47,85 --> 00:17:55,26
or I mean I think that I mean so that you can you can now go back to doing surgery without hygiene you just don't even

158
00:17:55,26 --> 00:17:57,46
clean your hands. You know and.

159
00:18:02,15 --> 00:18:05,95
I think there are many things like this that would be there would seem like science fiction

160
00:18:05,95 --> 00:18:18,5
but if you created it in a realistic enough fictional universe people people kids especially will will dream about it

161
00:18:18,5 --> 00:18:33,86
and make it happen. From a should expect. Well I expect everything. Not I made it.

162
00:18:33,91 --> 00:18:40,9
You know it's it's it's funny you know and I when says anything gigantically on it.

163
00:18:40,92 --> 00:18:47,26
Well my family was very concerned because my father had died of senile dementia

164
00:18:48,38 --> 00:18:53,72
and they were worried that I would had some risk factors and so far it looks like I have the opposite.

165
00:18:53,99 --> 00:19:00,83
I have no risk factors so maybe that's surprising. Maybe itself is false assurance.

166
00:19:03,89 --> 00:19:09,61
You know that future was just something that feels like a fortress right.

167
00:19:12,36 --> 00:19:17,7
I'd certainly feels that way to me every day I get somebody walks in and gives me something that shocks me

168
00:19:17,7 --> 00:19:18,96
and it's not easy to shock me

169
00:19:20,39 --> 00:19:32,00
but it's very common that they'll come up with something that really changes the way we approach biological research.

170
00:19:33,57 --> 00:19:40,02
When Well well for example getting nana for sequencing that was some.

171
00:19:40,44 --> 00:19:46,26
It's a way of you have a handheld device that is capable of sequencing D.N.A.

172
00:19:50,94 --> 00:19:59,23
Engineering mosquitoes so that they can spread really good genes through the environment that would make them resistant

173
00:19:59,23 --> 00:20:11,66
to. Malaria parasite. Every little breakthrough in each of those two projects. This is remarkable.

174
00:20:11,67 --> 00:20:25,42
What you think of the creatures. I'm one of the biggest critics of it.

175
00:20:25,52 --> 00:20:31,88
I try to raise consciousness and make people concerned because if you are not concerned.

176
00:20:31,9 --> 00:20:42,52
Things can be unintended consequences if you are concerned. At lower it helps you plan for alternatives and. But.

177
00:20:44,14 --> 00:20:54,42
In particular I suggested over the last eleven years that twelve years that we should have a surveillance mechanism in

178
00:20:54,42 --> 00:20:58,31
place where anybody that participates in these powerful technologies

179
00:20:59,51 --> 00:21:07,62
and all the ordering that they do of supplies should be monitored by the companies

180
00:21:07,62 --> 00:21:13,58
and ideally by the governments as well that I mean that's so you wouldn't want surveillance on your everyday activities

181
00:21:13,58 --> 00:21:15,73
but if you're if you're dealing with synthetic D.N.A.

182
00:21:15,73 --> 00:21:20,46
That's not everyday activity and nobody forcing you to work on synthetic D.N.A.

183
00:21:20,46 --> 00:21:27,44
But if you choose to work on some that if you know than Then you need to be under surveillance. Because.

184
00:21:27,46 --> 00:21:35,28
We're in a time where we don't know what you what how powerful is and so it's better to just have a writhing.

185
00:21:35,3 --> 00:21:35,75
Under surveillance

186
00:21:36,48 --> 00:21:42,76
and in particular why propose was looking for people synthesizing things that are extremely hazardous things like

187
00:21:42,76 --> 00:21:47,52
smallpox and polio and anthrax toxin

188
00:21:47,52 --> 00:21:54,01
and things like that because there's no reason that the only way they should only be ordering that if they have

189
00:21:54,01 --> 00:22:02,28
permission from the government to order it and that very good reason. It's very easy.

190
00:22:02,3 --> 00:22:06,00
And so you know we have to monitor how they order it as D.N.A.

191
00:22:06,00 --> 00:22:10,13
but You need to monitor the machines in the chemicals that they can use to do it themselves.

192
00:22:10,61 --> 00:22:15,13
But if you monitor everything that really reduces the probability they could do it themselves.

193
00:22:16,25 --> 00:22:31,24
It's also yes receivers were able to get. Yeah crisper has a lot of power but it's probably not the most dangerous.

194
00:22:31,72 --> 00:22:38,34
I mean I I'm not trying to reassure people I'm just saying if you're going to worry worry about the right they which is

195
00:22:38,34 --> 00:22:42,62
worry about ordinary pathogens that you can find.

196
00:22:44,38 --> 00:22:50,3
You know in every you know all over the world because those are much more powerful than anything you can do a crisper

197
00:22:50,3 --> 00:22:57,69
today. Crisper is crisper and all of our amazing technology for reading and writing D.N.A.

198
00:22:58,45 --> 00:23:03,51
Is now you can use it for better surveillance.

199
00:23:03,76 --> 00:23:08,03
I mean if it's a million times cheaper you can have it distributed network of surveillance.

200
00:23:08,29 --> 00:23:14,18
You can make faster and better vaccines that are very responsive to emerging threats where the natural or unnatural

201
00:23:15,41 --> 00:23:18,84
and so forth. I think that that that the revolution in reading or writing D.N.A.

202
00:23:19,78 --> 00:23:28,34
Is much more easily used for protection and prevention and it is for misuse misuse you just go out

203
00:23:29,28 --> 00:23:31,62
and get somebody who's got some serious disease

204
00:23:32,73 --> 00:23:56,24
and weaponize them with with ordinary methods not modern molecular biology. And so I mean if you like the way. Like.

205
00:23:57,1 --> 00:23:59,87
This. Well a slight difference between this and the Internet.

206
00:24:00,00 --> 00:24:04,06
I think as we have the opportunity of having a higher security

207
00:24:04,78 --> 00:24:10,51
and safety mean I think in the Internet early days that it wasn't a top priority.

208
00:24:10,53 --> 00:24:21,55
But I think and you ended up with kind of a culture that includes hackers and computer viruses and credit card

209
00:24:21,55 --> 00:24:28,29
or just identity theft and stalking and and so forth and.

210
00:24:28,31 --> 00:24:32,88
I think if you had that the equivalent thing in biology would be much more serious.

211
00:24:32,91 --> 00:24:36,38
So if you have a computer virus some might cause billions of dollars of damage

212
00:24:37,36 --> 00:24:40,69
but a real virus could cause billions of dollars damage

213
00:24:40,69 --> 00:24:53,85
and millions of lives so I think we need to create a culture of surveillance and in good deeds and. You know. Yes.

214
00:24:53,86 --> 00:24:56,81
Yes it is but we need to keep.

215
00:24:57,45 --> 00:25:04,09
Keep raising consciousness and keep that motivation going you know it's good to stay critical.

216
00:25:04,27 --> 00:25:24,71
So this right and where your future or what I please. Once you are getting confused by myself you know self.

217
00:25:24,72 --> 00:25:34,2
Boss and future Fiat humans what do you think that here. But it was definitely the case that that.

218
00:25:34,6 --> 00:25:40,18
One of the distinguishing features of human beings is our ability to think very deeply about the past

219
00:25:40,18 --> 00:25:48,55
and predict the future and thereby avoid future existential risk to ourselves our family

220
00:25:48,55 --> 00:25:59,49
and to in fact the entire planet. So in particular asteroids and super volcanoes could could.

221
00:26:00,00 --> 00:26:03,69
Destroy all of civilization or at least throw it back into the dark ages.

222
00:26:04,2 --> 00:26:14,36
By eliminating the social fabric and cooperation. That and that is that's that's even if we do nothing wrong at all.

223
00:26:14,59 --> 00:26:22,03
That's if we just a you know we we don't create some killer virus we don't pollute our atmosphere would we do if we

224
00:26:22,03 --> 00:26:23,23
don't create global warming.

225
00:26:23,25 --> 00:26:28,68
If we do everything right because we can still buy as a species and so I think the the end of go to.

226
00:26:28,68 --> 00:26:35,91
That is to get us off the planet as a sort of the space genetics planetary species

227
00:26:35,92 --> 00:26:46,42
and we have to start spreading outside of the planet. Also one of your goals.

228
00:26:47,18 --> 00:26:54,62
Yeah I think we have a consortium for space without a center here Harvard but international and

229
00:26:54,62 --> 00:27:01,02
and one of the is to raise consciousness about the needs the special needs that you have.

230
00:27:01,52 --> 00:27:17,97
That have to do with genetics in getting off the planet. You. The beauty of the human genome.

231
00:27:17,99 --> 00:27:26,05
It's beautiful on spiraling because it is in a certain sense very simple and very complicated. There's parts of it.

232
00:27:26,06 --> 00:27:31,00
We don't understand their parts of it that are amazingly predictive and we understand well enough.

233
00:27:32,62 --> 00:27:41,28
It's beautiful and the. It's a simple set of four letters G. A T.N.-C. And so in a way you can you can.

234
00:27:41,33 --> 00:27:43,34
Once you get a little education.

235
00:27:43,82 --> 00:27:48,22
You can read you can read it just by looking at it which it couldn't didn't have to be that simple.

236
00:27:49,27 --> 00:27:53,42
Everybody talks about how complicated it is but really once you have a little bit of training.

237
00:27:53,65 --> 00:28:01,52
It's amazing how much you can get out of human and other genomes. It's a beautiful. Structure.

238
00:28:01,71 --> 00:28:10,09
You know has a very elegant in the two strands in the way it replicates by separating the many things about the end it

239
00:28:10,09 --> 00:28:20,3
is beautiful. You knew can make build machines out of it you can. And you can print books. But you're you.

240
00:28:20,62 --> 00:28:30,08
You're just because you see very soon you are working. You are you are you know everything that comes with the right.

241
00:28:30,12 --> 00:28:42,46
Astronaut driving through writing more and more and more. And that's what we are. I always did that far right.

242
00:28:42,6 --> 00:28:46,89
Yes So when I say is simple. I'm doing it from an unusual standpoint.

243
00:28:47,52 --> 00:28:54,05
It would be like an astronaut saying Oh it's simple to walk on the moon. Well maybe for you. It is.

244
00:28:54,07 --> 00:28:59,67
And what happens is once you get a certain number of technologies working that nobody else in the world can use not

245
00:28:59,67 --> 00:29:05,89
because we've kept it a secret. I mean we've we've shared it openly. It's and we're very interested in open access.

246
00:29:06,13 --> 00:29:10,61
It's just that nobody can. Even though it's open.

247
00:29:10,62 --> 00:29:16,25
They can't Nestle practices that easily or they don't trust it or to be as easy as it looks

248
00:29:16,25 --> 00:29:19,9
and so then we have the opportunity of using it for a couple years and

249
00:29:19,9 --> 00:29:25,39
and putting together another layer of of inventions and another on top of that

250
00:29:25,39 --> 00:29:28,84
and recombining them in various ways to get hybrid inventions

251
00:29:28,84 --> 00:29:35,77
and it just keeps in this positive feedback loop keeps going and it's a very funny.

252
00:29:35,86 --> 00:29:43,42
It's a very funny experience is like. You know it's like diving off a cliff.

253
00:29:43,44 --> 00:29:49,15
You get faster faster as you hit the water. You're looking at.

254
00:29:49,35 --> 00:30:06,13
Yeah there may be what may just be free fall and the free fall with a few people. It's. Because if you. You know there.

255
00:30:06,18 --> 00:30:06,65
There's a.

256
00:30:07,24 --> 00:30:15,75
There's a a large research community but within that as a smaller set the due to technology

257
00:30:16,8 --> 00:30:20,9
and there's even smaller set the does radical basic enabling technology so.

258
00:30:20,95 --> 00:30:25,24
So some of the technology developers might develop a particular drug for a particular disease

259
00:30:26,21 --> 00:30:33,55
but then there's a tiny set that develop technology which can be applied to almost anything so reading or writing D.N.A.

260
00:30:33,55 --> 00:30:38,95
Can be applied to any organism and it can be applied even to things that are not biological like.

261
00:30:39,42 --> 00:30:48,85
But and those tools can be applied to themselves which because what creates this exponential the just growing faster

262
00:30:48,85 --> 00:30:52,41
and faster. Is that the tools that you used to engineer D.N.A.

263
00:30:52,41 --> 00:31:02,39
Can be used to engineer the tools that used to engineer D.N.A. It's very cyclic and and so that's.

264
00:31:02,41 --> 00:31:16,03
That's playful exponentially growing. Means that. Well it goes very possible. What. If you.

265
00:31:17,09 --> 00:31:19,47
Will hopefully what will bring us is is.

266
00:31:19,49 --> 00:31:27,78
Higher safety rather than less safety and that requires that we talk about a lot and to be very thoughtful about it.

267
00:31:27,78 --> 00:31:39,29
Encourage the new generation to be focused on safety security and modeling and. Extensive testing.

268
00:31:39,31 --> 00:31:46,83
But it but other than that. The minute it will bring us whatever we want. It's unlimited that it.

269
00:31:47,15 --> 00:31:51,61
The question is not so much what it will do it's what are the few things that it won't do.

270
00:31:51,79 --> 00:31:57,65
You know for example even computers which currently now are not biological those could easily be biologically the

271
00:31:57,65 --> 00:31:59,82
future the most amazing computer in the world.

272
00:32:00,00 --> 00:32:04,23
Old is is the human mind and

273
00:32:04,96 --> 00:32:13,86
and if that if the human mind starts modifying itself then it becomes even more amazing than than a human trying to

274
00:32:13,86 --> 00:32:24,84
make a computer that fit the can't yet think the way human can. And. Can be there. Will you vs.

275
00:32:24,85 --> 00:32:31,63
Be made as if it could be it yet.

276
00:32:31,7 --> 00:32:40,01
Could it could be revolutionary in terms of how unrecognizable it is a few years from now so fair were you organize

277
00:32:40,01 --> 00:32:51,57
your life. Right. If you were sure what way is right.

278
00:32:52,38 --> 00:32:56,65
I mean it's much easier to illustrate the revolutions in the can I call in electrical engineering.

279
00:32:57,25 --> 00:33:05,75
You know you can build a you know like in days of Edison you can build a crude prototype for a motion picture camera

280
00:33:05,75 --> 00:33:12,81
and projector and that's fairy you can touch it you can feel it you can understand how it works.

281
00:33:14,51 --> 00:33:22,91
If you were to create a futuristic vision today. Most of the mechanisms would be invisible they'd be so small that you.

282
00:33:22,92 --> 00:33:26,62
There's no real way of observing them directly.

283
00:33:28,15 --> 00:33:31,86
And even if you could observe them me it's hard to understand what they're doing because we don't are not used to

284
00:33:31,86 --> 00:33:35,07
thinking the way the molecule thinks like you know.

285
00:33:35,47 --> 00:33:44,77
A molecule might crisper molecule in order to cut it might jump around to six billion different places randomly keeping

286
00:33:44,78 --> 00:33:49,83
knocking on the same wrong door until it finally finds the right place and then it will act.

287
00:33:49,86 --> 00:33:54,33
I mean that's very different from how you would build a cuckoo clock.

288
00:33:54,42 --> 00:33:59,9
You know where it does exactly what you want to do right. So I think people are not you.

289
00:34:00,00 --> 00:34:10,2
Thinking molecularly but I try to encourage my lab to think like a molecule. You know. Just.

290
00:34:10,21 --> 00:34:17,25
Well they don't they're there they're very random they day they and they're fast and so you might try.

291
00:34:19,78 --> 00:34:25,38
You know four hundred times a second to do something and only get it right about once

292
00:34:25,38 --> 00:34:34,98
and twenty like making proteins and rivals some so you know. This is random but yeah.

293
00:34:36,42 --> 00:34:40,89
But also the randomness of the mole at the atomic molecular scale

294
00:34:40,89 --> 00:34:48,02
but then all of the the evolved machinery of life that overcomes that randomness

295
00:34:48,02 --> 00:34:56,18
and makes it very non random survey sample when you're chromosome separate when your daughter's cells replicate.

296
00:34:56,2 --> 00:34:58,44
It's almost perfect. It's not random.

297
00:34:58,71 --> 00:35:01,62
And so that you know what you're doing is using the random noise

298
00:35:01,62 --> 00:35:08,7
and of the energy of the cell to make nearly perfect decisions it should be random

299
00:35:10,51 --> 00:35:23,1
and going back to the idea that you think these we have to create a kind of you can start a sperm and.

300
00:35:23,12 --> 00:35:25,25
There you go wait.

301
00:35:25,27 --> 00:35:30,64
It's changed things for you or you can change idiom before the sperm

302
00:35:30,64 --> 00:35:40,29
and egg get together you can change it in the sperm itself. You know like a human built two point zero.

303
00:35:40,31 --> 00:35:51,06
You can create you. Right. I mean you can you can alter what we were already altering adult humans with gene therapy.

304
00:35:51,08 --> 00:35:59,88
It's not just in ways that that correct something that's wrong with that that correct. An inborn in hair.

305
00:36:00,00 --> 00:36:07,09
To mutation there are even some where we augment them as adults. For example making them resistant to HIV.

306
00:36:07,59 --> 00:36:13,44
I mean it still is medicine because they are they might be at risk or already have AIDS.

307
00:36:14,48 --> 00:36:21,12
But the way you do it is is not by the chemical that kills the AIDS virus.

308
00:36:21,47 --> 00:36:33,51
It's making it's like changing the human body so that no longer has the receptor for the HIV the virus particles.

309
00:36:35,1 --> 00:36:41,81
Now it's like. It's like being not worth it if you are able to.

310
00:36:42,5 --> 00:36:52,61
We're not only facing as you would if you were if you were you were in the middle of this scientific revolution.

311
00:36:52,63 --> 00:36:54,65
That's credible.

312
00:36:56,19 --> 00:36:59,14
You know it's like right now it's not hard to stay motivated

313
00:37:00,46 --> 00:37:05,14
when you have a lot of people in the lab that are enjoying themselves

314
00:37:05,14 --> 00:37:16,48
and making revolutionary breakthroughs on a regular basis very easy to get everybody motivated because I also work for

315
00:37:16,48 --> 00:37:23,75
a literary right at the bleeding cutting edge of science and technology.

316
00:37:24,71 --> 00:37:39,6
So we're going to be working day you're little how do you. If they wasn't that the for radio days.

317
00:37:39,61 --> 00:37:51,03
I usually get up around four o'clock in the morning without an alarm on my own and I work until my wife

318
00:37:51,03 --> 00:37:59,95
and I walk in together or work on the same department same floor. It's just a short walk and so so from.

319
00:38:00,00 --> 00:38:02,97
About four in the morning till about nine I get to do.

320
00:38:05,34 --> 00:38:10,01
Good think and work on it without any interruptions

321
00:38:11,17 --> 00:38:19,1
and then then I then my day is packed with with talking science with my students and post-doctoral fellows

322
00:38:20,38 --> 00:38:28,04
and looking at their experiments and designing and interpret ing and then.

323
00:38:28,06 --> 00:38:32,25
You know I usually don't take a break for lunch or anything

324
00:38:32,25 --> 00:38:38,77
and then at the end of the day I walk back home with my wife and sometimes I get to.

325
00:38:41,58 --> 00:38:47,74
Visit with my daughter and granddaughter who live next door and.

326
00:38:48,58 --> 00:39:01,26
Then that's the sit you know if you meet this you treat your reviewers you know.

327
00:39:02,33 --> 00:39:08,63
Well I'm not a collect Dick I have some kind of genetic problem that makes me fall asleep all the time

328
00:39:09,32 --> 00:39:18,71
and during the day even though I get totally normal night's sleep with you know it's dark it's quiet I'm I fall asleep

329
00:39:18,71 --> 00:39:26,51
quickly at night and I don't wake up in the middle of the night but nevertheless there in the day I fall asleep and

330
00:39:27,27 --> 00:39:35,27
and what happens is I superimpose the dream state on the reality and I can always tell the difference

331
00:39:35,27 --> 00:39:42,33
and I'll talk in my sleep and and but it's sometimes it's very helpful.

332
00:39:43,45 --> 00:39:50,19
Usually it's a nuisance but sometimes it helps me solve problems and makes me look at things differently.

333
00:39:53,72 --> 00:40:05,8
Well I'm not sure I've seen alternative ways of looking at it. The dream state is very. Unusual and and creative and.

334
00:40:05,82 --> 00:40:12,66
Allows you to get out of a rut thinking about things the same way you thought about them before you almost always look

335
00:40:12,66 --> 00:40:14,96
at them differently in dreams.

336
00:40:15,9 --> 00:40:23,65
You're right no no no it's just that sometimes I'll have a difficult sometimes if I have a really difficult problem it

337
00:40:23,65 --> 00:40:24,67
will.

338
00:40:24,68 --> 00:40:31,74
Mice all the shut down and then when I wake up I have the answer is I don't have to write it down

339
00:40:32,77 --> 00:40:38,21
and I now know the answer in other cases it'll just something strange will happen in my right.

340
00:40:38,24 --> 00:40:41,18
A few notes but I'll just forget about it and then.

341
00:40:41,54 --> 00:40:54,01
A month later I'll realize oh yeah that was actually something that was useful. You know. Where you gave expect.

342
00:40:54,02 --> 00:41:01,26
Your work. Yeah.

343
00:41:01,45 --> 00:41:10,8
Our scientific world I mean doesn't really develop itself it needs funding it needs an educated population to support

344
00:41:10,8 --> 00:41:22,67
it and to and to join as is the next generation. So it's very far from self. Renewing.

345
00:41:24,08 --> 00:41:26,75
But there is a component of it where we

346
00:41:26,75 --> 00:41:32,35
and where we might inspire some of the other things that we need we might inspire people to fund as he might inspire.

347
00:41:32,36 --> 00:41:42,92
Youth to join. But a lot of it is it was a very unusual set of motivations and skills.

348
00:41:43,16 --> 00:41:51,77
Not everybody has not everybody reacts to a statement as oh I'm going to look that up you know most people they they

349
00:41:51,77 --> 00:41:55,00
say oh it's I don't believe it or I do believe it.

350
00:41:55,16 --> 00:42:00,55
I don't care but they don't say all look it up on research and I'm going to prove. Disprove it.

351
00:42:01,41 --> 00:42:05,36
But that's almost the that's the natural response of the half and and.

352
00:42:05,82 --> 00:42:11,09
And even if you look at up in use and you see evidence for it in the online

353
00:42:11,1 --> 00:42:14,88
or in the literature you say now I still need to check it.

354
00:42:15,04 --> 00:42:21,8
I need to do a controlled double blind study and make sure that it's really there wasn't any researcher bias.

355
00:42:22,27 --> 00:42:27,61
That's for things. So the scientists are very unusual breed in that sense it's really.

356
00:42:28,39 --> 00:42:35,2
Some of them don't even you know they don't need reminders that this is this is how they is really it's deep in their

357
00:42:35,9 --> 00:42:42,89
body in their soul as to how they. How they think about the world. With deep curiosity playfulness.

358
00:42:44,1 --> 00:42:56,19
But this rigor of inquiry. Were you surprised that there's no way. Yes you're right.

359
00:42:58,86 --> 00:43:09,6
And brought me up that everybody was using because you know it was because for every side as well. Right.

360
00:43:11,03 --> 00:43:16,1
Well most of the technologies are not usable until a technologist makes them usable.

361
00:43:16,24 --> 00:43:18,98
I mean that they may be derived from nature.

362
00:43:19,11 --> 00:43:23,95
I mean in fact they may be very sophisticated machines you know so for example D.N.A.

363
00:43:23,96 --> 00:43:31,32
Plumber race robbers soem crisper these are all very very very complicated machines would be very hard to make from

364
00:43:31,33 --> 00:43:34,48
scratch. You know from first principles on drawing board in.

365
00:43:35,09 --> 00:43:39,08
Any factoring that you can make once you see them you can make variations on them

366
00:43:39,08 --> 00:43:42,23
but making the first one without a hint would be very hard.

367
00:43:44,65 --> 00:43:50,08
But then but then the technologists is needed to change that from a natural form into something that's useful

368
00:43:51,01 --> 00:43:56,92
and then to improve it improve until finally it's usable by non technologists.

369
00:43:56,93 --> 00:44:02,5
And the usual reason they don't pick it up is because the technologist. Either hasn't really made it work.

370
00:44:02,59 --> 00:44:07,56
I mean it sort of kind of works works well enough to publish but not well enough for you to for someone else to use

371
00:44:07,56 --> 00:44:14,24
or it works but it's not very well documented not very user friendly.

372
00:44:15,09 --> 00:44:21,1
So you can like he can have a computer that works but doesn't have any graphics doesn't have any.

373
00:44:22,04 --> 00:44:27,36
And he were real way of. WERNER a person could interface with.

374
00:44:27,38 --> 00:44:32,62
So I thought totally surprising that when people don't pick up a technology what's more surprising is when it takes

375
00:44:32,62 --> 00:44:34,93
when you don't even have to give it a nudge.

376
00:44:35,6 --> 00:44:41,15
It's like crisper you just basically publish a paper in and put some plasmids in and Gene

377
00:44:41,15 --> 00:44:48,15
and suddenly everybody gets the work. That's the more that's the more unusual situation.

378
00:44:48,2 --> 00:44:56,09
You know out of maybe a couple of dozen of technologies I've developed may be five of them are that easy for people to

379
00:44:56,09 --> 00:45:07,47
adopt like crazy. Well you know some things are require a new instrument.

380
00:45:07,49 --> 00:45:13,87
And the new and new instruments require software and Sue got all the engineering conventional mechanical electrical

381
00:45:13,87 --> 00:45:20,81
and software engineering that you need to get them so that takes about five years from the concept to something that

382
00:45:20,81 --> 00:45:27,92
people can use. When you're to have something that's basically what you found in the wild.

383
00:45:27,93 --> 00:45:33,4
Then things that you find in nature tend to be highly evolved this is if an engineer made them

384
00:45:33,4 --> 00:45:37,5
but whether they were involved or however they got that way they're there.

385
00:45:38,95 --> 00:45:52,75
They've got a good user interface sometimes they they they do what you expect those to do. So why is it so general.

386
00:45:53,53 --> 00:45:54,6
You know the general public.

387
00:45:54,61 --> 00:45:59,34
I mean we know scientists pick that up because it's easy to program the G.'s a Stephen C's.

388
00:46:00,00 --> 00:46:03,73
I think it's just John probably they're a little strange.

389
00:46:04,16 --> 00:46:12,34
You know it's like probably the name is a very cute name which was nobody really intensely made a cute name recently

390
00:46:12,34 --> 00:46:12,75
anyway.

391
00:46:14,3 --> 00:46:23,63
Part of it is because you know there was some odd patent issues having to do with the got some people's attention.

392
00:46:26,03 --> 00:46:31,63
I think part of it is just there were like it's like it's like there was a.

393
00:46:33,35 --> 00:46:41,02
Pent up kind like an overdue slot machine or a. It's a tsunami that's coming in off the shore and just before it.

394
00:46:41,04 --> 00:46:45,11
It was a whole bunch of technologies that just before they hit shore.

395
00:46:46,64 --> 00:46:49,68
You know you blame it on one of them what but it's really the whole collection.

396
00:46:50,08 --> 00:46:56,21
So I think it's a combination of those things that the name the patterns and and

397
00:46:56,97 --> 00:47:13,99
and the a lot of the things that came up that have been building up for decades. We were right.

398
00:47:13,99 --> 00:47:17,75
Well I think you know I think it's ability to read and write D.N.A.

399
00:47:17,75 --> 00:47:21,4
and It's some of it's editing and some of it's rewriting D.N.A. From scratch.

400
00:47:21,69 --> 00:47:30,36
There's a whole collection of technologies that is suddenly many factors of ten maybe a million times easier to use

401
00:47:30,36 --> 00:47:36,39
more accurate and less expensive and crisper gets most of the credit

402
00:47:36,39 --> 00:47:42,67
but it's there's this whole other thing sometimes called next generation sequence saying there are ways of synthesizing

403
00:47:42,67 --> 00:47:52,64
D.N.A. On chips these things if you didn't have all these things crisper would be much less interesting. You know.

404
00:48:00,00 --> 00:48:14,13
You know it's so much right for me and my family. Well nobody really knows what it means in the same sense that people.

405
00:48:14,4 --> 00:48:20,63
If you ask even the greatest visionary in computer science in the one nine hundred fifty S.

406
00:48:20,63 --> 00:48:27,48
What the computer revolution meant he or she would. You know probably not guess right.

407
00:48:27,69 --> 00:48:35,7
They probably would not guess Facebook or you know it. Maybe even not even Google search engines or Google Maps.

408
00:48:37,5 --> 00:48:43,91
You know they might as said oh it will be used for calculating logarithms for. Rockets.

409
00:48:44,23 --> 00:48:47,53
So you can do warfare better or we can do accounting better.

410
00:48:48,63 --> 00:48:57,76
So we can so that people don't have to have human calculators. So you know I think the same thing is well for.

411
00:48:57,77 --> 00:49:02,16
What society will do with this enhanced ability to read and write D.N.A.

412
00:49:02,94 --> 00:49:10,49
Is we will modify or selves in our environment and the way we obtain food and.

413
00:49:10,5 --> 00:49:18,76
All the materials that we use including very smart materials like computers all these things will be altered beyond

414
00:49:18,76 --> 00:49:34,39
recognition. In a fairly short period of time. That what we did well I was alive a nine hundred fifty.

415
00:49:35,67 --> 00:49:38,77
Yeah we might be the equivalent time but everything's moving faster now

416
00:49:38,77 --> 00:49:42,52
and one of the things this will be faster is are billeted to reverse aging.

417
00:49:42,91 --> 00:49:50,42
So if we can reverse aging then yes you will definitely be around to see all sorts of things because.

418
00:49:50,43 --> 00:49:56,5
There's no there's no particular there's a lot physics that we know of that requires aging.

419
00:49:56,52 --> 00:50:01,79
We know that there are there's a continuity of law. I think that goes back three billion years.

420
00:50:01,98 --> 00:50:06,47
So there's no particular reason why.

421
00:50:07,39 --> 00:50:13,4
That humans or animals in general have to have to senescent get old and

422
00:50:13,4 --> 00:50:21,86
and break because there's cotton some of the cells in the body keep on living in the in the next generation.

423
00:50:21,88 --> 00:50:26,7
That's where you are. Yes right.

424
00:50:27,03 --> 00:50:36,56
You have a very act we have a very active projects plural on the on Aging reversal not so much on one seventy where you

425
00:50:36,56 --> 00:50:40,78
don't want to prolong the end of life which is unpleasant and expensive

426
00:50:41,79 --> 00:50:49,3
and it where you become you know less productive member of society less engaged you want it what you want to do is

427
00:50:49,3 --> 00:50:53,11
reverse it back to a time where you were at your optimal performance.

428
00:50:54,37 --> 00:51:06,73
You know a young person like sixty five years old. Well it's been it's not only possible it's been done in animals.

429
00:51:07,4 --> 00:51:12,05
And now those animals may or may not be good models for human

430
00:51:12,05 --> 00:51:17,99
but it's certainly is the time is ripe for testing things that either cause longevity in animals

431
00:51:17,99 --> 00:51:24,76
or as universal animals and then test to see if thing cause aging Resulin in larger animals and humans.

432
00:51:28,75 --> 00:51:35,22
Well there are many there are many things that have been shown to increase the animal lifespan by a factor of two to a

433
00:51:35,22 --> 00:51:40,09
factor of ten. There are things that involved. I mean not to get too technical.

434
00:51:40,48 --> 00:51:48,01
But the mitochondria the the tips of chromosomes the teal mirrors the the.

435
00:51:48,03 --> 00:51:53,51
Growth factors and muscle related proteins like myostatin pathway.

436
00:51:53,71 --> 00:51:59,65
So all these pathways are pretty well understood and if you harness a little beach for gene therapy.

437
00:52:00,00 --> 00:52:06,99
Then you can try them separately in combination seen their views particularly easy to go from an idea to a test of it

438
00:52:07,98 --> 00:52:18,86
you don't have to take a side route where you randomly screen through millions of pharmaceutical compounds that reverse

439
00:52:18,86 --> 00:52:24,77
aging right because you're able to offer far that your genes are already.

440
00:52:25,99 --> 00:52:31,36
Well we have lots of demonstrations in animals both of longevity extreme extension of longevity

441
00:52:31,36 --> 00:52:35,98
and reversal in some cases many different ways of doing that

442
00:52:35,98 --> 00:52:42,11
and so we're collecting all of those that are known for small animals and we're applying them to large animals

443
00:52:42,11 --> 00:52:43,98
and humans the gene.

444
00:52:44,83 --> 00:52:49,46
You know coming of the gene therapy trials is much easier but we're still just beginning

445
00:52:50,79 --> 00:52:54,21
and that it's looking very promising but it's too early to say

446
00:52:55,47 --> 00:52:58,78
and something that might even work for large animals may still not work for humans.

447
00:53:00,11 --> 00:53:11,57
What kind of what is a lot of work through no you really think your research for your part where you work you like

448
00:53:11,57 --> 00:53:27,1
these as soon as well I mean top priority. I guess would be transplant patient organs.

449
00:53:27,12 --> 00:53:36,22
Malaria for developing countries and aging reversal for industrialized nations and privet preventative medicine

450
00:53:36,22 --> 00:53:38,78
and general strategy.

451
00:53:39,38 --> 00:53:49,5
And then right behind all of those once those are all working a we you know improve our facing human condition then

452
00:53:49,5 --> 00:54:11,94
space in it's sick. We sure were you. Yeah. So the project the most compelling and exciting.

453
00:54:13,13 --> 00:54:24,31
In terms of applications are transplant patients of organs there's a gigantic need for that gene drives to eliminate

454
00:54:24,31 --> 00:54:28,2
malaria and then for developing nations

455
00:54:28,2 --> 00:54:34,11
and then aging reversal for industrialized nations where most of the morbidity

456
00:54:34,12 --> 00:54:40,09
and mortality is due to disease of aging you know you get the core of that

457
00:54:40,09 --> 00:54:46,61
and then once you have all those things which are drains our economy if you can solve all those and you can reduce

458
00:54:47,63 --> 00:54:53,7
and you have more money available for things like space where we really need to get off the planet old boy super

459
00:54:53,7 --> 00:55:03,99
volcanoes and asteroids. And that has a genetic component as well. While we have.

460
00:55:04,93 --> 00:55:17,61
Radiation sensitivity and our bones rot at low gravity and so even not only in in traveling. Let's say to Mars.

461
00:55:18,38 --> 00:55:26,5
But even once you arrive there it's gravity is thirty eight percent of Earth's And so our body was designed for normal

462
00:55:26,5 --> 00:55:30,98
gravity and as soon as you stop as soon as you don't have normal gravity you have muscle

463
00:55:30,98 --> 00:55:38,1
and bone wasting because the body thinks it's doing a feedback loop a physiological feedback loop to keep everything

464
00:55:38,1 --> 00:55:45,33
right but it's just Eve need to have muscles and bones even and low gravity because you need you know

465
00:55:45,33 --> 00:55:52,35
when you need touch something with weak bones you'll you'll cross your own sound

466
00:55:53,05 --> 00:55:59,13
and you need muscles to move things around. So anyway. Those are some of the things that are.

467
00:56:00,00 --> 00:56:03,31
Problematic in space and also there's questions like What do we bring with us.

468
00:56:03,39 --> 00:56:12,26
Do we bring all the species of the earth or do we leave out the Giant Sequoia and the bowhead whale and smallpox

469
00:56:12,27 --> 00:56:26,69
or do we you know. We could you know but you know it's it is we haven't done that yet. We have not. Really recreated.

470
00:56:27,41 --> 00:56:30,33
And so it's a big decisions whether you take it with you. In fact some of them.

471
00:56:30,39 --> 00:56:36,29
It could be there for their ecosystem is fragile enough that you can't really make it with our current knowledge.

472
00:56:36,63 --> 00:56:38,42
So having the complete D.N.A.

473
00:56:38,42 --> 00:56:44,47
Sequence of everything on the planet may not be enough to recreate some of the more complex ecosystems.

474
00:56:45,48 --> 00:56:59,55
When you say yes that's great. Yeah. Yes We're big on on novel tool sets. You know the story.

475
00:57:00,71 --> 00:57:04,16
So a nine year old girl sent us.

476
00:57:04,62 --> 00:57:12,89
Two copies of that poster and we put it on the wall as but it's based on our she had read about our project.

477
00:57:13,98 --> 00:57:15,21
In the news.

478
00:57:15,23 --> 00:57:16,26
It's a small project

479
00:57:16,26 --> 00:57:23,78
and mainly benefits from the technology we've developed for other projects like human medical research.

480
00:57:23,8 --> 00:57:30,41
But these things we bring the price down a million fold and then you can use it for reading and writing the N.S.A.

481
00:57:30,41 --> 00:57:31,73
From ancient samples

482
00:57:32,73 --> 00:57:39,42
and in the I made it with a mammoth is that the Asian elephant is the closest relative to the mammoth

483
00:57:39,42 --> 00:57:43,81
and it's so close in fact they're both closer to each other than they are to the African elephant

484
00:57:43,81 --> 00:57:45,47
and the Asian elephant can breed

485
00:57:45,47 --> 00:57:52,39
and make offspring children with the African elephant so probably the Asian elephant in the Mammoth are basically very

486
00:57:52,39 --> 00:57:59,95
close to being interfertile And so one way of of focusing on modern day species.

487
00:58:00,00 --> 00:58:04,86
Seas is to extend the range of the Asian elephant it will already play in the snow

488
00:58:04,86 --> 00:58:12,88
but you could extend it all the way out to minus forty degrees in the tundra of Canada Russia Lascaux

489
00:58:14,17 --> 00:58:16,75
and furthermore so you get a benefit to the elephant

490
00:58:16,75 --> 00:58:21,44
but you also get a benefit to the tundra because the tundra is melting and this could

491
00:58:21,44 --> 00:58:30,79
and there's experiments in the field studies that indicate that a mammoth like creature could keep temperature colder

492
00:58:30,79 --> 00:58:36,12
by up to twenty degrees in temperature.

493
00:58:36,14 --> 00:58:45,49
So the experiments were that the idea follow up my experience is that trees Zorba about twice as much light

494
00:58:45,49 --> 00:58:51,93
and so that that's a warming effect and. The grasses.

495
00:58:51,95 --> 00:58:55,23
Have roots that protect from erosion

496
00:58:55,23 --> 00:59:00,93
and then punching down the snow the big you have big flea insulating layer of snow in the wintertime if you punch that

497
00:59:00,93 --> 00:59:01,33
down.

498
00:59:01,49 --> 00:59:04,59
Now you can get penetration of the cold winter air

499
00:59:06,15 --> 00:59:10,69
and these three things put the mammoths were the sort of the elephants or maim us will knock down trees

500
00:59:10,69 --> 00:59:17,32
and replace them with grass and a much richer ecosystem full of some small animals.

501
00:59:17,34 --> 00:59:25,33
Anyway they did the experiment replacing mammoths with a combination of caribou which is one of the biggest mammals

502
00:59:25,34 --> 00:59:33,59
and tanks Soviet tanks that would knock down the trees because caribou can't knock down trees elephants in the way it

503
00:59:33,59 --> 00:59:44,73
was about fifteen to twenty degrees. That is the difference between the experimental and the control site. Yes right.

504
00:59:44,89 --> 01:00:00,56
Yes. Yeah well you haven't scratched the surface yet. But you like. I think we covered a goods sampling of it.

505
01:00:03,24 --> 01:00:13,05
Cover the Personal Genome Project. Data incorporation and D.N.A. Future and we covered it.
