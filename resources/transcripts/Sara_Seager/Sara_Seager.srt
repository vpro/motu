1
00:00:00,41 --> 00:00:01,14
OK.

2
00:00:01,19 --> 00:00:08,26
My name is Sara Seager I'm a professor at MIT I am an astrophysicist I work on planets orbiting stars other than other

3
00:00:08,26 --> 00:00:19,94
than the sun we call them exoplanets. Of Stars Yeah so for every star in the sky is the sun.

4
00:00:21,42 --> 00:00:26,23
And there are literally billions of suns or stars in our galaxy.

5
00:00:27,19 --> 00:00:35,33
So like the Suns was the sun is more or less the center of our universe

6
00:00:35,33 --> 00:00:43,09
but our sun is just one of billions of stars hundreds of billions of stars orbiting all bound together in a galaxy we

7
00:00:43,09 --> 00:00:52,14
call the Milky Way. Yeah so many stars. And now we actually think that we think that every star has a planetary system.

8
00:00:53,44 --> 00:00:59,26
So if there's hundreds of billions of stars there could be trillions of planets in our galaxy alone.

9
00:00:59,27 --> 00:01:18,66
And actually there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. So. That's one followed by lots of zeros. So.

10
00:01:18,68 --> 00:01:23,82
Well it took decades if not centuries or thousands of years you know for us to figure out what's out there.

11
00:01:25,55 --> 00:01:34,56
But actually now astronomers have found planets thousands of them everywhere we look every star that our technology can

12
00:01:34,56 --> 00:01:38,69
find a planet around we do find a planet. Almost every star.

13
00:01:38,71 --> 00:01:45,3
And so we just are piecing it all together about the range of planets and what's out there. We also see.

14
00:01:45,32 --> 00:01:55,64
Star forming discs we see that when stars are discs. We also see when stars are born. They're born with a gas.

15
00:01:55,75 --> 00:02:00,77
They're born. We also see when stars are born. They have. Discovery on them.

16
00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:05,7
That's kind of full of junk leftover material and we see that around almost all stars

17
00:02:06,98 --> 00:02:09,51
and out of that that junk that dust

18
00:02:09,51 --> 00:02:17,51
and gas that's left over planets are going to form like forms like the like our planetary system formed.

19
00:02:17,67 --> 00:02:28,48
Yes that's right. So how do I know myself. Right.

20
00:02:28,54 --> 00:02:33,33
As you do you know that's kind of one of those complicated things in science because we can't repeat every experiment

21
00:02:33,33 --> 00:02:38,2
ever done. Like for example my building at work you'll see it. You're going to love my office.

22
00:02:38,74 --> 00:02:41,18
And if it's a clear day even if we're not filming up there.

23
00:02:41,2 --> 00:02:46,46
I'm going to take you up to the roof because we can see the entire city skyline of Boston we can see over to the ocean

24
00:02:46,46 --> 00:02:48,62
of we're lucky if it's a clear day

25
00:02:48,62 --> 00:02:54,81
and we climb up this little crossness ladder that leads to a little crossness we can see over to the White Mountains in

26
00:02:54,81 --> 00:02:58,22
New Hampshire. Now I'm guessing you wouldn't want to jump off that building.

27
00:02:58,28 --> 00:03:04,44
Because you believe in the laws of gravity. So some things are accessible to us we believe in gravity.

28
00:03:04,46 --> 00:03:09,2
And we believe in some laws of physics but we believe in all the laws of physics but some of the marks esle to us.

29
00:03:09,39 --> 00:03:12,13
So it's kind of a complicated thing to get into right away

30
00:03:12,13 --> 00:03:15,76
but in science we believe on these building blocks starting with things that we experience

31
00:03:16,46 --> 00:03:18,7
and some things get more complicated and more abstract.

32
00:03:19,35 --> 00:03:19,88
And

33
00:03:19,88 --> 00:03:28,00
when it comes to exoplanets in some cases the measurement of detection of that planet is incontrovertibly we really can't

34
00:03:28,01 --> 00:03:29,97
describe it to anything else but a planet.

35
00:03:30,5 --> 00:03:36,04
In other cases we see like an indirect measurement of a planet and in that case.

36
00:03:36,12 --> 00:03:38,78
Sometimes it's a bit of a leap of faith to believe it's a planet.

37
00:03:39,43 --> 00:03:45,5
And in some even more extreme cases a planet detection will later be retracted because it looked like a planet was

38
00:03:45,5 --> 00:03:47,4
there. But it turned out to be something else.

39
00:03:49,25 --> 00:03:57,83
It's like noise like if you give you an algae that will make sense to you if you take a picture and it's very grainy.

40
00:03:53,85 --> 00:03:59,99
and blurry you think you see something like a U.F.O. And you know you you. You're not sure.

41
00:04:00,09 --> 00:04:03,8
It kind of looks like something you can recognize you're not a hundred percent sure.

42
00:04:03,81 --> 00:04:09,41
Later you go back and take better images and you see what you thought was there was just a it was just noise.

43
00:04:09,62 --> 00:04:13,49
It was just nothing an artifact. So we sometimes see that as well.

44
00:04:21,4 --> 00:04:29,57
I have many different positions in this field the one I started out in is studying planet atmospheres like on our own

45
00:04:29,57 --> 00:04:33,83
Earth we have air that we breathe. All these other planets also have their version of air.

46
00:04:34,29 --> 00:04:38,93
It might be hydrogen or helium or it might be carbon dioxide or something else

47
00:04:38,93 --> 00:04:41,44
but it's to study these atmospheres of planets far away.

48
00:04:42,03 --> 00:04:46,45
And to try to understand what those atmospheres are made of that's my main.

49
00:04:46,47 --> 00:04:54,33
And that's one of the main things that I started out doing. There's lots of people working on this. Now when I started.

50
00:04:55,00 --> 00:04:59,76
There were very few almost nobody was working on this but now it's amazing. Actually if I could.

51
00:05:01,82 --> 00:05:02,95
Yes it's just remarkable.

52
00:05:03,37 --> 00:05:09,7
Now that the things that I like there are the field was so new when I started that

53
00:05:09,7 --> 00:05:16,57
when people were finding planets other people accused the people finding planets of stamp collecting you're just

54
00:05:16,57 --> 00:05:19,35
collecting these things were going to do with them. It's hard enough to find them.

55
00:05:19,91 --> 00:05:21,99
And many of the findings people didn't believe her.

56
00:05:22,08 --> 00:05:29,48
So they're wondering why was I wanted to study their atmospheres which is even harder to do. So it's amazing.

57
00:05:29,49 --> 00:05:31,84
Now that today. It's twenty years later.

58
00:05:32,88 --> 00:05:39,9
Not only do we have dozens and dozens of planet atmospheres measured but such a standard Now you can come to MIT

59
00:05:39,9 --> 00:05:44,8
and go to a talk next Tuesday a visiting professor will be talking about exoplanet atmospheres

60
00:05:44,8 --> 00:05:47,71
and how complex they are it's now bread and butter mainstream astronomy.

61
00:05:47,96 --> 00:06:03,74
So there's lots of people working on it right now. Well right.

62
00:06:04,94 --> 00:06:11,77
Yes really great question WAS NEXT that Tim such a hard question. But actually again we build on many decades of work.

63
00:06:12,43 --> 00:06:13,69
So for a long time.

64
00:06:13,95 --> 00:06:19,92
Astronomers have used spectroscopy we break up the white light of the sun or star into different colors

65
00:06:19,92 --> 00:06:26,31
and we look for lines that are missing little pieces of let's say the rainbow the spectrum that are gone

66
00:06:26,31 --> 00:06:28,64
and from that we infer the presence of atoms and molecules.

67
00:06:29,16 --> 00:06:32,39
So if you want to know the truth people before us did all the hard work

68
00:06:33,47 --> 00:06:37,42
when they did all the hard work even looking at the sun

69
00:06:37,42 --> 00:06:41,95
and stars we can see many different atoms in the photo sphere of of the sun and stars

70
00:06:41,95 --> 00:06:45,91
and you know it took people a long time to believe that stars were made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

71
00:06:46,26 --> 00:06:50,61
So the tools we use and the Applied Physics were using in the atomic

72
00:06:50,61 --> 00:06:53,47
and molecular physics people worked hard to understand that

73
00:06:53,47 --> 00:06:59,25
and fought with each other about what was believable what was not so we're taking this decades old technique

74
00:06:59,25 --> 00:07:07,29
and applying it to planets. And so we have two problems one is to get good enough data so we can see a robust signal.

75
00:07:08,99 --> 00:07:12,35
And again like back to the image you could have a very blurry image in low light

76
00:07:12,35 --> 00:07:14,1
and you could think you're seeing something

77
00:07:14,1 --> 00:07:19,14
and you wouldn't be able to prove to someone else that you're really seen the scene you think you're seeing.

78
00:07:19,35 --> 00:07:21,85
So we have to have good enough data so everybody can look at the data.

79
00:07:22,34 --> 00:07:35,63
Every Strummer and they'll say yes I do see a spectral feature I do see a signal but the noise. It's not a picture no.

80
00:07:35,65 --> 00:07:46,9
You know I could. Well think of how to explain this to you. I do have a. Yes we do.

81
00:07:47,15 --> 00:07:50,82
Like I wish I could show this to you. Maybe maybe tomorrow. I can show you a picture.

82
00:07:50,98 --> 00:07:55,17
I have a nice printer at my office but what I'm just going to walk you through it now

83
00:07:55,99 --> 00:07:59,18
but what we do is we imagine rain. Imagine for a moment you see a rainbow.

84
00:08:00,09 --> 00:08:04,81
If you could look at that rainbow very closely you would see that some parts of the colors are missing.

85
00:08:05,71 --> 00:08:11,12
You would see literally out of that rainbow color the red orange yellow green blue you would actually see little pieces

86
00:08:11,12 --> 00:08:14,86
that look black black lines as if someone took a marker and just drew a black line.

87
00:08:15,11 --> 00:08:22,3
And that's we do that in astronomy we break up the white light of the sun or stars and we see some lines missing.

88
00:08:22,48 --> 00:08:27,01
But those lines aren't just sharp they may have a gradient at the edges would be a bit fuzzy at the edges

89
00:08:27,01 --> 00:08:31,91
and very dark in the center and believe or not in the old days people would take photographic plates

90
00:08:31,91 --> 00:08:37,06
and they record these you know they have a prism that broke up the light into colors

91
00:08:37,06 --> 00:08:41,34
and they would literally see these dark lines and they put it on a table in China late through it

92
00:08:41,34 --> 00:08:44,82
and then they would measure how much light gets through where these dark lines are

93
00:08:44,82 --> 00:08:55,65
and from that they would make a curve. So now. No light. Let me think this. OK so no lights getting weight.

94
00:08:56,08 --> 00:09:00,84
They'd say no lights getting through than all the sudden a lot of light gets through you know it would be some kind of

95
00:09:00,84 --> 00:09:04,29
curve that is somewhat. And then they'd have another little blip and then another one.

96
00:09:04,53 --> 00:09:07,02
And that's how we met make a measurement of the spectrum.

97
00:09:07,28 --> 00:09:12,71
Not with photographic plates anymore it's all digital and from that yes we have to do interpretation.

98
00:09:12,73 --> 00:09:18,19
But we understand how atoms and molecules absorb radiation both from calculations of quantum mechanics

99
00:09:18,19 --> 00:09:23,1
and also from laboratory measurements and so yes it may seem like a leap of faith.

100
00:09:23,67 --> 00:09:27,95
But we are building our knowledge and tools that have been used for decades for astronomy

101
00:09:27,95 --> 00:09:33,68
and for Earth's Earth's atmosphere observing. We're doing.

102
00:09:33,84 --> 00:09:40,95
Yes in some ways yes we are doing the hard work for future scientists because the signals weren't study now are so weak

103
00:09:40,95 --> 00:09:47,96
and so faint and the techniques we have to use are brand new compared to how we study stars in our own earth this year.

104
00:09:53,56 --> 00:09:55,45
And have to think about that for a minute see.

105
00:09:57,07 --> 00:10:01,02
And by the way that's just a tough question to ask because each of you could. Ask yourself the same thing.

106
00:10:01,02 --> 00:10:06,27
Why are you doing what you're doing know at some level we just don't know I mean we do it because we just love doing it

107
00:10:06,27 --> 00:10:09,4
and it seems exciting and fun and it's it's amazing.

108
00:10:09,47 --> 00:10:15,59
But I have to say for myself even ever since I was a child I always wondered what is out there

109
00:10:15,59 --> 00:10:19,2
when I saw the sky for the first time the dark sky really really dark.

110
00:10:19,84 --> 00:10:26,9
Tons of stars like so many stars I couldn't believe it. No one had I had never even known that that was out there.

111
00:10:26,92 --> 00:10:31,9
Ever since I saw those stars part of me has always wondered what else is there.

112
00:10:31,92 --> 00:10:34,18
But there's another attraction to that's a little more.

113
00:10:34,47 --> 00:10:36,74
You know there's that one thing that sense of wonder

114
00:10:36,74 --> 00:10:40,33
but that's not what happens on a daily basis because we're just you know getting through the day

115
00:10:40,33 --> 00:10:41,94
and getting our tedious work done.

116
00:10:42,08 --> 00:10:44,85
But there's this other really beautiful thing in science

117
00:10:44,85 --> 00:10:49,08
and that is that you can explain the world around you with equations.

118
00:10:49,09 --> 00:10:54,87
And just the fact that we can write down basically starting with some very basic laws of physics

119
00:10:55,97 --> 00:10:58,48
and then some more complicated ones like with quantum mechanics.

120
00:10:59,14 --> 00:11:07,47
And gravity and pressure and we can work through all these basic things these building blocks of physics

121
00:11:07,47 --> 00:11:14,32
and describe an atmosphere far away and get data with the Hubble Space Telescope and actually interpret all that

122
00:11:14,32 --> 00:11:17,84
and make sense from it using basic physics is very satisfying.

123
00:11:27,05 --> 00:11:44,37
I mean we have discovered a lot of things they're a little more academic in a way. It doesn't it's not quite that.

124
00:11:44,38 --> 00:11:50,45
You know that abrupt that you see something so I can try to think about. OK You know I can explain that.

125
00:11:50,52 --> 00:12:00,02
Yeah let's see. Yes the times when we when we like my team or I you know get data and see something that.

126
00:12:00,09 --> 00:12:03,98
Just so shockingly unexpected it's extremely exciting.

127
00:12:04,00 --> 00:12:08,46
It doesn't happen very often and sometimes it happens and it turns out to be nothing when you go back

128
00:12:08,46 --> 00:12:14,14
and take more observations but you know that moment of discovery is just amazing.

129
00:12:14,53 --> 00:12:21,78
It doesn't happen often enough to be the main reason why you know why I'm a scientist. But it's definitely exciting.

130
00:12:21,8 --> 00:12:24,51
I have a different type of excitement though and the reason why I do it is.

131
00:12:26,45 --> 00:12:30,17
I can conceive of an idea of something that just seems truly unheard of an amazing.

132
00:12:30,88 --> 00:12:34,49
And then it can take a year or two or more sometimes to just work through the possibility.

133
00:12:34,5 --> 00:12:40,96
And when you find out that something that this crazy thing you thought of turns out to be right. That's a discovery.

134
00:12:41,16 --> 00:12:47,02
I can maybe work on trying to articulate this but you know there is that sense of discovery of getting data

135
00:12:47,02 --> 00:12:51,61
and seen a signal going Wow I just can't believe we found this I can't believe a planet like this

136
00:12:51,61 --> 00:12:56,09
when I think I found exists. That's definitely an aha moment but there's another more complicated.

137
00:12:56,17 --> 00:13:01,06
A ha moment where we conceive of something and work through a project.

138
00:13:01,58 --> 00:13:06,73
And you find something just totally amazing that you hadn't thought of founding for and that is just so amazing

139
00:13:07,49 --> 00:13:12,45
and actually one of these I'll just tell you a little bit about it because it's my favorite project right now

140
00:13:13,15 --> 00:13:15,58
and you'll meet one of the team members tomorrow at work.

141
00:13:15,59 --> 00:13:18,26
We'll talk and Remy had specifically asked us to talk about this

142
00:13:18,26 --> 00:13:24,35
but it was actually I was working on a project about bio signature gases gases that life might produce

143
00:13:25,11 --> 00:13:25,7
and at that time.

144
00:13:25,79 --> 00:13:28,81
Charles and I we actually just were celebrating our first year of marriage

145
00:13:28,81 --> 00:13:33,59
but at that time we were just kind of getting to know each other and he'd ask me a question

146
00:13:34,55 --> 00:13:39,19
and Charles had asked me well out of all those molecules in our atmosphere in Earth's atmosphere.

147
00:13:39,58 --> 00:13:44,57
How many of those does life produce and it was an amazing question because I looked it up.

148
00:13:44,69 --> 00:13:47,61
I didn't know and I went through tables of what's in Earth's atmosphere

149
00:13:48,78 --> 00:13:55,55
and I found that every gas in our atmosphere to the part petroleum level by volume so if you would capture.

150
00:13:55,56 --> 00:13:59,67
Part per trillion. So if you would to capture like a canister of air.

151
00:14:01,63 --> 00:14:03,62
And measure how much gas is in there

152
00:14:03,62 --> 00:14:09,17
and like you know for every cubic centimeter one part in a trillion is a certain type of gas.

153
00:14:09,21 --> 00:14:11,43
So all gases in our atmosphere just means many of them.

154
00:14:11,47 --> 00:14:16,22
There's about three dozen of them up to that level of abundance. They're all produced by life.

155
00:14:17,47 --> 00:14:23,76
Now most of them have a dominant production from some other source like Jew physics like volcanoes

156
00:14:23,76 --> 00:14:28,39
or photochemistry in the atmosphere but they're also all produced by life and this is amazing

157
00:14:29,22 --> 00:14:30,67
and this is the type of thing that's like Ha.

158
00:14:30,92 --> 00:14:33,26
Is that just some weird coincidence or does it have meaning

159
00:14:34,00 --> 00:14:39,52
and so that I actually worked with the project I was already working on about the range of gases that life on earth

160
00:14:39,52 --> 00:14:50,63
produces it set off a kind of chain of events because I had a theory that I thought partly based on this question about

161
00:14:50,63 --> 00:14:53,93
what's in our atmosphere that life produces all gases.

162
00:14:54,05 --> 00:14:57,64
I thought perhaps life produces every single gas we can ever imagine.

163
00:14:58,94 --> 00:15:06,32
And so I started on a long project I had to convince two of my biochemistry colleagues why I had to convince one of my

164
00:15:06,32 --> 00:15:10,46
main colleagues. He works in biochemistry to do the project and he thought it was silly.

165
00:15:10,55 --> 00:15:17,03
Actually that was the most silliest thing he'd ever heard. He refused to work on it. Hate.

166
00:15:17,08 --> 00:15:20,06
Well then I managed to get another person interested

167
00:15:20,06 --> 00:15:22,9
and I did a kind of scientific matchmaking between these two people

168
00:15:22,9 --> 00:15:24,94
and we all three of us started to work on the project

169
00:15:25,85 --> 00:15:33,02
and ultimately we collected a list of all molecules that are in gas form at temperatures we call them standard

170
00:15:33,02 --> 00:15:36,9
temperature and pressure that's are like room temperature room pressure surface pressure on earth

171
00:15:37,67 --> 00:15:38,97
and we found that it's not true actually.

172
00:15:39,24 --> 00:15:45,38
So in this case despite this excitement that I might have come across this concept that life produces all gases it

173
00:15:45,38 --> 00:15:46,48
turned out to be completely wrong.

174
00:15:46,69 --> 00:15:53,55
Actually it's not so it's only true that life produces about a quarter of those gases a quarter of everything

175
00:15:53,55 --> 00:15:58,8
but we found something even more interesting actually on this journey that in the set of.

176
00:16:00,09 --> 00:16:00,82
Molecules

177
00:16:00,82 --> 00:16:08,82
or molecular fragments that are that exist in general that there are certain pattern amongst the fragments of molecules

178
00:16:08,82 --> 00:16:14,11
that life doesn't produce so life seems to prefer producing producing some types of molecules

179
00:16:14,81 --> 00:16:21,99
and other types of molecular fragments life never produces And so right now we're pursuing that avenue of research to

180
00:16:22,00 --> 00:16:27,48
see what it what it entails and we think it may actually be very helpful in the end for toxicology

181
00:16:27,48 --> 00:16:35,38
and perhaps even from ecology so that actually is so exciting because we sort out with one thing it's like we're

182
00:16:35,38 --> 00:16:38,65
tracking to the South Pole we have a goal we're going to get there.

183
00:16:38,68 --> 00:16:41,32
We have a destination want to go to the South Pole

184
00:16:41,32 --> 00:16:47,04
but instead we discover something else that there's this mountain in Antarctica it's really worth exploring.

185
00:16:47,24 --> 00:16:50,81
And we hike up that mountain then we went in the wrong way. Then we have to go a different way.

186
00:16:50,84 --> 00:16:54,8
And finally we get somewhere that was just so breathtakingly amazing we never conceived of it

187
00:16:55,52 --> 00:16:57,6
and we're in the process of doing that now.

188
00:16:57,61 --> 00:17:00,73
And we're not at the point where we can say that we found something amazing

189
00:17:00,73 --> 00:17:12,33
but I really feel strongly that this is going to be awesome. OK that's a good one.

190
00:17:16,45 --> 00:17:21,09
Sometimes yes sometimes I feel like I'm in a wilderness.

191
00:17:22,92 --> 00:17:28,22
Well in this particular wilderness The funny thing is we have to learn our skills as we go.

192
00:17:28,23 --> 00:17:32,56
It's like we're only outfitted with the most rudimentary gear.

193
00:17:32,58 --> 00:17:35,57
And we have to develop our tools and find out what we need as we go.

194
00:17:35,59 --> 00:17:41,43
Actually it's one of reminds me to a bit of exploring I used to spend a lot more time in the outdoors than I do now.

195
00:17:41,63 --> 00:17:45,27
When I was younger and you go on a trip and not know what you're doing.

196
00:17:46,36 --> 00:17:49,94
We're going to trip and maybe you'd make a mistake and something would go wrong.

197
00:17:50,00 --> 00:17:54,00
Maybe you're just wet all night because you couldn't your tent was leaking or you had some problem

198
00:17:54,00 --> 00:17:57,45
and the next time you know you can go home and think through what you did wrong and go back out there

199
00:17:57,45 --> 00:18:03,03
and do a better job see it for longer. Comfortable. Be more skilled at navigating.

200
00:18:03,38 --> 00:18:07,52
And so we have a chance to go back and learn things I learned Python.

201
00:18:07,7 --> 00:18:13,43
It's now language that everybody knows how to use so when it's Python. OK so you guys don't know how to use it.

202
00:18:13,51 --> 00:18:16,33
It's a computer language. Yeah computer language.

203
00:18:17,67 --> 00:18:22,43
OK because if you said I just learned Python at MIT I'd be like really. You're like a child.

204
00:18:22,45 --> 00:18:27,92
OK So what happened was it's like I'm liking that skill I need a new skill.

205
00:18:27,97 --> 00:18:32,67
Because what we're dealing with is we call it's a big data problem and informatics problem.

206
00:18:33,11 --> 00:18:36,42
And we have to we still just like the explorer in the outdoors.

207
00:18:36,74 --> 00:18:41,36
We can go back and outfit ourselves in a better way and that actually involves just learning a new skill.

208
00:18:42,00 --> 00:18:48,75
So I did learn how to program Python I did like an online class. You can you know with Python and programming.

209
00:18:48,98 --> 00:18:51,7
It's like learning a language like you can learn and try to you can go.

210
00:18:51,79 --> 00:18:56,84
Let's say to somewhere foreign to us like let's say Asia. You could pick up a few words enough to get around.

211
00:18:57,34 --> 00:18:59,6
Or you could decide you're going to learn that language very thoroughly

212
00:18:59,6 --> 00:19:08,73
and do it right from the start so that you have what you need to get through whatever situation you encounter. So yes.

213
00:19:08,74 --> 00:19:14,27
Python computer programming language.

214
00:19:14,29 --> 00:19:18,15
Well was more because we now have fourteen thousand molecules what are we going to do with them

215
00:19:18,15 --> 00:19:19,37
or the fragments of molecules

216
00:19:20,23 --> 00:19:26,11
and we have to now compare those to lists of toxicity molecules that are toxic we have to be able to go to websites

217
00:19:26,11 --> 00:19:30,61
and get information by what we call scraping them and we have to go

218
00:19:30,61 --> 00:19:37,77
and retrieve a lot of data we have to you know mass be able to mass compare things with each other in a way that this

219
00:19:37,77 --> 00:19:39,6
particular language makes it very easy to do.

220
00:19:42,85 --> 00:19:54,42
Oh is there a danger you think oh right in this case what I mean is what in this case what we're trying to do is see

221
00:19:55,12 --> 00:20:00,04
whether the fragments of molecules are building blocks in any way for anything related to lie.

222
00:20:00,09 --> 00:20:10,01
If on earth and well they're not talks at chemicals we're just doing things like in our computer. Oh yeah me something.

223
00:20:14,73 --> 00:20:16,55
Well Or yeah.

224
00:20:16,65 --> 00:20:17,61
Let me mix plane a little better

225
00:20:17,61 --> 00:20:28,01
but in this particular application it's not related exoplanets what we're thinking is that this.

226
00:20:29,35 --> 00:20:36,6
You know our joy Norma's database now that has molecular fragments and molecules that life that we know if life.

227
00:20:36,71 --> 00:20:40,74
We don't know but we've tabulated from the literature that whether life produces it

228
00:20:40,74 --> 00:20:44,95
or not if there's a bunch of molecules or fragments of all kills that life is not producing

229
00:20:46,00 --> 00:20:51,26
and those same molecular fragments show up in toxic chemicals.

230
00:20:51,28 --> 00:20:58,68
You know gives us a clue about new chemicals that may be toxic. Hope that was helpful.

231
00:20:58,85 --> 00:21:06,11
We're just trying to use see what we're just starting to see what this what we think we've got the information we've

232
00:21:06,11 --> 00:21:07,57
gathered on molecules and whether or not.

233
00:21:07,65 --> 00:21:13,12
Life on earth produces them whether it has some other application somewhere in environmental science or

234
00:21:13,12 --> 00:21:26,56
or in drug discovery here on Earth. That's right. Quest.

235
00:21:26,73 --> 00:21:35,73
My main quest is to find another planet like earth and to study planets to see if any of them have signs of life.

236
00:21:38,74 --> 00:21:43,12
With signs. It's a big question in it's a great job.

237
00:21:43,31 --> 00:21:48,46
It's a great quest because science fiction has laid out so many possibilities for us already.

238
00:21:49,47 --> 00:21:54,18
And we like to say science fiction is becoming science fact. At least in terms of our research.

239
00:21:56,92 --> 00:21:59,92
I'm sure it's I'm sure there is life out there somewhere. There.

240
00:22:00,09 --> 00:22:02,92
Are hundreds of billions of stars in our Milky Way galaxy

241
00:22:04,1 --> 00:22:07,09
and we think there are hundreds of billions of planets out there.

242
00:22:07,11 --> 00:22:19,46
So you know why because well the ingredients for life are everywhere we look in astronomy water is very common.

243
00:22:19,53 --> 00:22:21,76
It's an extremely common planetary building block

244
00:22:21,76 --> 00:22:30,57
when we look into interstellar space the disk the almost nothingness between stars we can see astronomers actually

245
00:22:30,57 --> 00:22:32,18
still see complex organic molecules.

246
00:22:33,37 --> 00:22:39,81
You know everywhere we look we see the ingredients for life stars can provide energy most you know there will be

247
00:22:39,81 --> 00:22:41,36
planets that have liquid water on them.

248
00:22:41,57 --> 00:22:47,52
And so it seems inevitable that if life arose here on Earth that it should also be able to arise on another planet

249
00:22:47,52 --> 00:22:50,26
somewhere else in our galaxy.

250
00:22:50,28 --> 00:22:53,97
There's a harder problem though because I am convinced that life is out there somewhere

251
00:22:55,12 --> 00:23:02,88
but the chance of us finding signs of life is a whole other question and that's a very very very challenging journey.

252
00:23:05,66 --> 00:23:13,5
You know it's not so much that that is also definitely a challenge the challenging thing is that planets are so small

253
00:23:13,5 --> 00:23:18,21
and faint it's extremely hard to observe them and we need to look at their atmospheres

254
00:23:18,21 --> 00:23:23,85
and assess all the gases in the atmosphere and find gases that don't belong that are in huge abundance

255
00:23:23,85 --> 00:23:29,16
and that the only way that gas could be in the atmosphere is because of life.

256
00:23:29,18 --> 00:23:32,99
And that's a very hard thing to do because we can we can we found thousands of planets

257
00:23:32,99 --> 00:23:35,61
and that we kind of have under control how to find them.

258
00:23:35,67 --> 00:23:42,03
But how to find enough planets who's who are how to find enough planets that are small like Earth

259
00:23:42,72 --> 00:23:50,59
and how to study their atmospheres in enough detail that is a very hard hard thing to do so.

260
00:23:55,00 --> 00:23:59,2
Right now we can't astronomers are constantly trying to assess.

261
00:24:00,09 --> 00:24:04,12
OK so you would not believe how much how many hours myself and my colleagues

262
00:24:04,12 --> 00:24:12,09
and other people have spent on trying to evaluate how common earth might be.

263
00:24:13,03 --> 00:24:14,45
And we actually don't have an answer right now.

264
00:24:14,67 --> 00:24:19,76
The answer that we work on scientifically it can range anywhere from two percent.

265
00:24:19,78 --> 00:24:26,11
That means like two in one hundred stars like the sun would have an Earth to one hundred percent that all stars like

266
00:24:26,11 --> 00:24:32,33
the sun would have a planet like Earth we really really don't know.

267
00:24:32,34 --> 00:24:38,33
Well there's a space telescope Kepler space telescope that was launched in two thousand and nine

268
00:24:38,33 --> 00:24:40,35
and Kepler stared at one patch of the sky.

269
00:24:41,03 --> 00:24:47,36
For four years and Kepler school was to answer the question How common are other earths that is Earth sized planets

270
00:24:47,36 --> 00:24:52,7
and Earth like orbits about sun like stars and for various reasons Kepler fell short of that goal

271
00:24:52,7 --> 00:25:00,92
but Kepler did tell us that small planets are extremely common small planets that are rocky around stars like the sun

272
00:25:00,92 --> 00:25:07,72
are very very common. So. Absolutely.

273
00:25:07,79 --> 00:25:13,7
I mean we have no doubt that there are small rocky planets out there in great abundance. But the different.

274
00:25:15,3 --> 00:25:21,81
Oh I think I have no doubt there is life out there somewhere.

275
00:25:22,84 --> 00:25:26,34
But the problem we have right now is it's only the very nearest stars.

276
00:25:28,01 --> 00:25:31,76
If they Who's if they have planets that are close enough and bright enough for us to study.

277
00:25:31,8 --> 00:25:34,59
So I've no doubt there is life out there somewhere in our galaxy

278
00:25:34,59 --> 00:25:37,99
or our universe it's almost inevitable just based on sheer numbers

279
00:25:37,99 --> 00:25:41,32
and the fact that building blocks of life are very common

280
00:25:42,1 --> 00:25:49,92
but if the harder question is can we find that any time in the near future because we're limited to studying the very

281
00:25:49,92 --> 00:25:54,23
nearest stars to our own sun.

282
00:25:55,1 --> 00:25:59,99
Be you know you can go and interview a biologist and ask them Do you think there's life out there and they might say.

283
00:26:00,09 --> 00:26:02,62
No No way no evidence.

284
00:26:02,83 --> 00:26:10,00
We don't understand how life on earth forms therefore we can't even speculate why I don't have any clues other than

285
00:26:10,00 --> 00:26:40,6
what I've given you. It's a lot of it's just pure faith admittedly. So. Your life. Absolutely.

286
00:26:40,78 --> 00:26:46,46
We just watched the movie Aliens. I hadn't seen it before actually.

287
00:26:46,48 --> 00:26:53,2
Seen your kids wanted to watch a family movie so were they just gotten old enough so we can all watch movies we all

288
00:26:53,2 --> 00:26:55,83
like you know kids are really little they just wanna watch a cartoon

289
00:26:55,83 --> 00:26:59,13
and scenery Weaver you know we watched the first alien.

290
00:26:59,79 --> 00:27:02,71
And then just the other night I thought it was really scary actually.

291
00:27:02,95 --> 00:27:07,45
There's this old ship that had crashed on a planet as these giant eggs

292
00:27:07,45 --> 00:27:09,15
and everything has been dormant for a very long time.

293
00:27:09,36 --> 00:27:12,53
Meanwhile there's a colony on the planet of people who didn't know about the ship.

294
00:27:13,01 --> 00:27:18,06
Until signori we were told the main character Ripley her spacecraft was found

295
00:27:18,06 --> 00:27:22,76
and she was revived from hibernation sixty years had gone by. And she told him about that.

296
00:27:22,92 --> 00:27:25,86
So they sent apparently had sent the colonists to go investigate the ship

297
00:27:25,86 --> 00:27:28,19
and I was suddenly hear nothing from the calmness on the planet.

298
00:27:28,31 --> 00:27:30,58
So she has to go back and see what's going on

299
00:27:30,58 --> 00:27:35,83
and these are the most scary aliens around you know they are going to kill people

300
00:27:35,83 --> 00:27:43,24
and they they basically capture the humans to act as incubate years for their new life or for their life forms.

301
00:27:43,26 --> 00:27:50,38
So there are there's a ton of them that people want life to be up there with because they weren't scared

302
00:27:50,38 --> 00:28:00,01
and I was then I have to explain it. It's my feel different. Right. Well I will say we're not going to find big sky.

303
00:28:00,09 --> 00:28:02,01
Monsters. So you don't have to worry about that.

304
00:28:02,05 --> 00:28:08,34
How do I know because the tools we have as astronomers right now we're just going to see gases produced by those aliens

305
00:28:09,47 --> 00:28:14,91
gases that they breathe out or you know gases that are produced by the plants that they're eating.

306
00:28:14,93 --> 00:28:24,01
And in fact we won't know what type of life is giving off those gases if it's just slime giant giant fields of bacteria.

307
00:28:24,03 --> 00:28:30,4
Well if they're big monsters like those aliens. I guess they had supposed they are big monsters well.

308
00:28:34,36 --> 00:28:38,71
If they're big monsters giving off gases we still won't know we'll just see the gases that don't belong.

309
00:28:38,97 --> 00:28:43,3
We'll do our best to disentangle that from any volcano volcanic commission

310
00:28:43,3 --> 00:28:51,15
and we'll we'll try to understand if it's if it's created by by life or if it's just what we call false positive.

311
00:28:51,28 --> 00:28:54,65
But how doing. But what will you know that's a different question.

312
00:28:54,94 --> 00:28:58,48
Now because then that question is can we go to the planet can they come here.

313
00:28:58,5 --> 00:29:12,99
And that is still science fiction for now how to get yeah yeah like imagination in science you know it's different from

314
00:29:12,99 --> 00:29:21,3
imagination in creating a film because in that case they can imagine a way the big technological challenges you know

315
00:29:21,3 --> 00:29:24,91
they don't have to explain how Ripley and the other crew can you get on a ship

316
00:29:24,91 --> 00:29:29,88
and hibernate for a while until they get to the new planet and land there and everything like that.

317
00:29:30,16 --> 00:30:00,5
So we definitely do use our imagination but not quite in that same way. Or. You know. One. More. Right.

318
00:30:02,84 --> 00:30:16,51
Or you know maybe. It's a tricky one. We have to think about that for a minute.

319
00:30:21,89 --> 00:30:26,04
Possibly you know we still need to use like our creativity and imagination in solving a problem.

320
00:30:26,61 --> 00:30:39,22
We have a vision of what we think we you know we're trying to get to we have to have that. When you do. What do I see.

321
00:30:39,27 --> 00:30:44,26
Well depending on the day.

322
00:30:45,33 --> 00:30:50,54
I mean I'm not sure actually that question's not an easy one for me to answer because I've not thought of.

323
00:30:51,41 --> 00:31:00,84
Not thought of it that way in a very long time. But I have to think more about it.

324
00:31:15,41 --> 00:31:24,31
Well there are definitely you know I'm not totally sure what you mean in terms of like creativity

325
00:31:24,31 --> 00:31:27,51
or you know envisioning your fantasy of what could happen.

326
00:31:27,72 --> 00:31:33,48
I mean it could come at any level like we have the Starship Project a giant specially shape screen we want to put in

327
00:31:33,48 --> 00:31:37,59
space and that wasn't my idea but the people who had thought of it in the one nine hundred sixty S.

328
00:31:37,59 --> 00:31:46,33
It is kind of a fantasy because it is kind of a fantasy because it's so far fetched like even for that to even be

329
00:31:46,33 --> 00:31:52,28
possible but over the decades we've whittled away at the Technological progress in trying to make that a reality.

330
00:31:53,26 --> 00:32:14,18
But now I feel like I need to be more creative has a fair question.

331
00:32:16,11 --> 00:32:27,69
You know there's definitely a lot of instinct involved. So there's you know in sometimes there's.

332
00:32:29,99 --> 00:32:34,71
You know there's two different types of instinct. One of them is it's like when.

333
00:32:35,17 --> 00:32:38,84
We're imagine we're in the wilderness and I see this river and I know I've got to get down the river.

334
00:32:39,53 --> 00:32:42,83
And there's giant Rapids and I just I think I can do this.

335
00:32:43,08 --> 00:32:46,21
And that's not a fact based intuition it's just a gut feeling

336
00:32:46,21 --> 00:32:49,87
and part of it's a desperation I need to get down that river I'm not going to get to where I'm going

337
00:32:50,66 --> 00:32:52,6
and you kind of take a leap of faith and just go for it.

338
00:32:53,48 --> 00:32:55,2
That's definitely one kind of tool or

339
00:32:55,2 --> 00:33:00,00
or instinct that I've used before I actually have a vision of what I think will happen

340
00:33:00,00 --> 00:33:01,73
but I have no idea how to get from A to B.

341
00:33:01,73 --> 00:33:07,64
and I have to take a leap of faith that I can do it even I don't really have the tools I'm just going to go.

342
00:33:07,66 --> 00:33:14,37
The other intuition. I have experience is one of accumulated. Six.

343
00:33:14,46 --> 00:33:15,96
Yes with that first type of intuition

344
00:33:17,42 --> 00:33:21,41
and then I know I can do it even though I don't still don't have the tools I know that I've been able to find the tools

345
00:33:21,41 --> 00:33:23,3
and that I can still do that one more time again.

346
00:33:24,79 --> 00:33:35,54
So I definitely intuition is a huge part of finding your way through here. I think I think so yeah actually I think.

347
00:33:35,55 --> 00:33:37,47
It's all touchy because you know. OK.

348
00:33:38,15 --> 00:33:42,53
I can't speak for my colleagues at MIT but I'm pretty sure we're all often accused of being arrogant.

349
00:33:42,83 --> 00:33:44,27
So I don't want to come across as too arrogant

350
00:33:44,27 --> 00:33:52,22
but yes I think I'm blessed with a special intuition in that because it's that everybody has it actually

351
00:33:52,22 --> 00:33:57,76
and most people ignore it or it's hidden or they don't use it. It's that gut instinct of this is right.

352
00:33:57,82 --> 00:34:00,72
I feel this is big. I'm going to do this.

353
00:34:01,9 --> 00:34:08,99
I know this is going to be big and I've had that feeling many times and yeah it's not part of this interview

354
00:34:08,99 --> 00:34:12,14
but I love talking about Charles because he and I had a great time we first met.

355
00:34:12,59 --> 00:34:17,74
I had my gut instinct about him like from like almost the second I met him like that's a sort of different thing.

356
00:34:17,76 --> 00:34:19,9
But many more people will you know wonder Sam that.

357
00:34:20,42 --> 00:34:22,03
But yes I have that in science

358
00:34:22,03 --> 00:34:28,67
and I have that about this project that's not is related to finding life elsewhere of all the molecules.

359
00:34:28,69 --> 00:34:42,14
And it's wonderful. Now because I'm able to. Trust my instinct.

360
00:34:43,29 --> 00:34:48,62
More like success actually I think it would be more like an instinct to succeed because I think survival is just like

361
00:34:48,62 --> 00:34:52,13
how do I get enough money to get food. I've got to make sure my children are safe.

362
00:34:53,6 --> 00:34:56,77
I think those things also involve instinct but it's more it's like the next level.

363
00:34:56,94 --> 00:35:00,98
Now that everything's OK and things function and I'm not worried about surviving.

364
00:35:01,34 --> 00:35:09,68
What can I do to just be a Super Chief or and make impact and reach all my dreams. I very well quit now.

365
00:35:09,89 --> 00:35:15,29
And so I'm having a moment of self reflection because now I. I feel like I need to do more.

366
00:35:16,47 --> 00:35:20,97
That's the ambitious part is person's problem you always feel like you need to do more and get more done

367
00:35:20,97 --> 00:35:26,87
and do bigger things I was in a bit of a rest period though in my career. Resting phase now.

368
00:35:28,31 --> 00:35:31,83
So I wasn't thinking in that way sort of taking some time off not time off

369
00:35:31,83 --> 00:35:42,25
but you know not working twenty four seven and going all out. Well my main thing I'm working on.

370
00:35:42,55 --> 00:35:48,74
Well you know you can expect is that in time I'll be able to report to you one way or the other whether

371
00:35:48,74 --> 00:35:57,75
or not we think we have found signs of life on another planet. Or. That wasn't tomorrow.

372
00:35:57,96 --> 00:35:59,45
That's like twenty thirty years from now.

373
00:36:02,24 --> 00:36:07,31
I said I can report one way or the other so I may come back and say around the nearest thirty stars.

374
00:36:09,23 --> 00:36:12,58
I might be able to say we have planets like Earth. We found five of them.

375
00:36:12,66 --> 00:36:16,95
We've studied their atmospheres one has a suggestion that it might have a sign of life

376
00:36:16,95 --> 00:36:19,62
but it's not good enough for us to say anything for sure.

377
00:36:19,88 --> 00:36:23,07
I might come back and report that but at least I would have answered it one way

378
00:36:23,07 --> 00:36:31,4
or the other for the nearest stars that we have this. Right but it is ambitious it's like us saying here is a group.

379
00:36:31,61 --> 00:36:36,22
We've just decided to go to the North Pole. We don't know how we're going to get there. But we think we can do it.

380
00:36:37,63 --> 00:37:04,7
So a lot of things have to work. You know or go over the life. It was alien. Right. Well I'm not. Yes that's right.

381
00:37:04,92 --> 00:37:24,66
It was alien. Yeah. Like. You were right and right.

382
00:37:24,81 --> 00:37:31,72
OK Let me think like well like yes and no because we're not finding the earth like we're going to go there or not us.

383
00:37:31,98 --> 00:37:35,63
Maybe someone in the future will figure that out but we're not going to go and go camping

384
00:37:35,63 --> 00:37:39,85
or we're not going to go there and like you know work through the wilderness and find giant monsters.

385
00:37:40,49 --> 00:37:43,6
It's just you know half of it's in our imagination going to see a point of light.

386
00:37:44,59 --> 00:37:48,81
It just a pale blue dot or a pale bread daughter just some little tiny thing.

387
00:37:48,82 --> 00:37:55,36
And all the interpretation we get we're like We started out talking about were interpreting what we see we can't

388
00:37:55,36 --> 00:38:01,95
guarantee this all we're not going to pictures of of civilizations or the Great Wall of China equivalent

389
00:38:01,95 --> 00:38:05,78
or pyramids we're not going to see any features like that we can see a point of light.

390
00:38:05,91 --> 00:38:06,99
We're going to know it's orbiting a star.

391
00:38:07,25 --> 00:38:11,75
We're going to be able to say something about the mass and size of the planet and what's in the atmosphere.

392
00:38:12,03 --> 00:38:16,58
What kind of air does that planet have and we're going to put a picture together based on scientific tools

393
00:38:17,59 --> 00:38:21,84
and that's how we're going to know if we found another Earth. So it's our modern day version of exploring.

394
00:38:23,09 --> 00:38:27,88
You know we've explored pretty much every landmass parts of the oceans remain unexplored

395
00:38:27,88 --> 00:38:29,45
but we know our planet very well right now.

396
00:38:30,68 --> 00:38:56,22
And space is a vast frontier that's still out there for us waiting to be explored who we were.

397
00:38:56,24 --> 00:38:57,93
Is starting to be possible for sure.

398
00:38:58,09 --> 00:39:04,61
I mean it's the first time ever in human history people have considered sending probes to other star systems.

399
00:39:04,63 --> 00:39:05,67
It's still quite a ways off.

400
00:39:05,89 --> 00:39:10,29
I believe some day humans will find a way to get there but it may be hundreds or thousands of years from now.

401
00:39:11,5 --> 00:39:17,93
I think our desire to explore is just so tremendous. But as humans we want to go we want to explore.

402
00:39:17,94 --> 00:39:27,95
We first have to go to Mars. You know. Me myself no I don't want to. I don't want to go to space.

403
00:39:28,02 --> 00:39:30,24
Actually I know that sounds.

404
00:39:30,26 --> 00:39:34,19
Thing is I don't like small spaces and I don't get along all that well with other people

405
00:39:34,19 --> 00:39:39,3
and I just don't want to be confined to a little tiny spot for the you know for decades.

406
00:39:40,33 --> 00:40:22,79
So space is a space ship of my own maybe you know once. You. You know if you know you know. Well see.

407
00:40:24,47 --> 00:40:30,57
What do I actually do. When I'm working there.

408
00:40:31,99 --> 00:40:39,00
Well I often work on my computer which programming or just other things meet with students

409
00:40:39,00 --> 00:40:47,62
and my research team members we talk about things and try to figure things out. Oh I'm thinking Yeah.

410
00:40:49,05 --> 00:40:53,81
I'm usually working and the best thing is I'm in the zone. You know when you're in the zone in the world goes away.

411
00:40:54,27 --> 00:40:55,6
You know you're doing your best work.

412
00:40:57,57 --> 00:41:02,43
OK Well I think if it happens like when you do your very best work

413
00:41:02,43 --> 00:41:06,46
and you're right where you're supposed to be then everything else goes away.

414
00:41:06,53 --> 00:41:08,7
It's just like you and yourself and your work

415
00:41:10,55 --> 00:41:16,3
and really just what happens is you might get a knock on the door a phone call and you snap out of it you know.

416
00:41:16,36 --> 00:41:21,82
Oh I didn't even realize but I was aware of the world around me I was just involved with what I was thinking.

417
00:41:23,78 --> 00:41:30,95
I mean this and then I'm in the zone. Yes actually.

418
00:41:32,81 --> 00:41:36,77
One time the first time I was in the zone actually that I realized that I was in high school

419
00:41:36,77 --> 00:41:38,63
and I was played in the band.

420
00:41:38,65 --> 00:41:44,82
And I had a piccolo It's like a flute smaller and I actually came across playing the piccolo or the flute but.

421
00:41:45,89 --> 00:41:49,59
I had a flute sometimes gets a special role it's like the singing voice because it's so high

422
00:41:50,34 --> 00:41:54,68
and at the very end of this piece I had to play it was just me and I was kind of obviously nervous and stuff

423
00:41:54,68 --> 00:41:57,05
and one time even missed it entirely. What.

424
00:41:57,72 --> 00:42:04,3
I had to get that and I realized when I said finish that little phrase with the flow.

425
00:42:04,54 --> 00:42:12,29
I was like oh my gosh there's a world here there's Marcus tra. But actually been lost in the sort of perfect.

426
00:42:13,54 --> 00:42:20,88
Non thought process of just being and playing the flute like a harmony like things were just happening

427
00:42:20,88 --> 00:42:26,8
and I wasn't aware of it at all. So if I can get in the zone. I know I'm getting my best work done.

428
00:42:28,23 --> 00:42:41,8
So we're almost center and you know when you enter it of we're just talking and these folks here go away

429
00:42:41,8 --> 00:42:47,06
and I forget about Charles I'm not worried about the kids getting home like his phone just you don't hear about it.

430
00:42:47,11 --> 00:42:50,06
I've looked at his phone it's his one of the kids actually has a job.

431
00:42:50,76 --> 00:42:51,47
He's eleven

432
00:42:51,47 --> 00:42:56,84
but he has like a babysitting job down the street so that lady just wrote him so that I'm not in the zone if I can see

433
00:42:56,84 --> 00:42:58,36
hear that phone and I see.

434
00:42:58,39 --> 00:43:05,27
Alisa wrote to him more times now day and we have a babysitter who's going to be coming soon

435
00:43:05,27 --> 00:43:08,24
and like oh if I'm not think about that stuff and all I can see is you

436
00:43:08,24 --> 00:43:13,31
and the question I'm thinking about the question and I'm not that and then we're in the zone so we can get in the zone.

437
00:43:14,94 --> 00:43:18,61
In fact the best like the best interviews

438
00:43:19,37 --> 00:43:25,26
and like if you're When people if they want to take my photograph it's very hard to do because you can't be like in the

439
00:43:25,26 --> 00:43:28,81
zone with unless you can get in the zone and like really give to the camera.

440
00:43:28,96 --> 00:43:32,1
You can't get the interviews or the pictures just don't come across right.

441
00:43:32,43 --> 00:43:36,75
It's very difficult actually now how do we get in the zone like I need a good night's sleep.

442
00:43:36,77 --> 00:43:40,00
I need to not be worried about other things I've got to put my phone away and not be distracted.

443
00:43:40,4 --> 00:43:42,23
I need to clear out all the things I'm worried about.

444
00:43:42,73 --> 00:43:44,06
The got to answer an e-mail

445
00:43:44,06 --> 00:43:49,67
or get a phone call out of the way so you know if I have a negative confrontation that has to happen at work.

446
00:43:49,7 --> 00:43:55,17
I've got to do all those things. So I can't force myself to be in the zone but I can create the right environment.

447
00:43:55,19 --> 00:44:03,49
So that I can focus. Right. It's because you're such a great interviewer.

448
00:44:05,47 --> 00:44:26,37
I wasn't expecting those I wasn't expecting this level of question so. Just. If you break it you know I understand.

449
00:44:32,03 --> 00:44:37,85
Something about it but I feel like everybody has a new might not know what you're saying to me.

450
00:44:38,6 --> 00:44:43,96
Sometimes you are in a flow. Like I use a White Water paddle.

451
00:44:44,93 --> 00:44:47,99
And if you're in like a hard wrap and you have no choice but to be in the zone.

452
00:44:48,2 --> 00:44:51,23
There's like you have to make these really quick decisions and there's big waves

453
00:44:51,23 --> 00:44:55,93
and you feel like you're part of the river and you're everything's just happening then you finish like so happy

454
00:44:55,93 --> 00:44:59,45
and you made it through in the that thrill and that scared ness is kind of gone.

455
00:45:00,03 --> 00:45:04,55
You just look around like wow OK but that moment you were in the rapids figuring out what to do and go

456
00:45:04,55 --> 00:45:08,98
and it was just pure being like pure living.

457
00:45:09,41 --> 00:45:15,74
You know I think a limp athletes must do it as well I think in their case they're there in the zone you know they're

458
00:45:15,74 --> 00:45:33,32
not thinking about dinner like what they have to do when they get home or.

459
00:45:40,96 --> 00:45:51,35
For a more common problem or argument from somebody else. Or maybe I'm on the wrong people.

460
00:45:51,54 --> 00:45:56,79
Or I think I'm just good at coming along on a lot.

461
00:45:59,03 --> 00:46:03,1
The zone is very special and doesn't happen all the time but I'm very good at compartmentalizing.

462
00:46:04,36 --> 00:46:09,39
Again I have a problem I can just not worry about it for a while. Unless it's a very big problem.

463
00:46:10,18 --> 00:46:13,02
OK so I have thought about this but I haven't really talked about it before anybody.

464
00:46:13,94 --> 00:46:16,48
I do see being a scientist like being in the limbic athlete.

465
00:46:16,65 --> 00:46:22,85
Like I need big periods of rest or literally just do nothing and I love my brain just like it's not watching T.V.

466
00:46:22,85 --> 00:46:26,11
It's not region a scary book. It's just like nothingness.

467
00:46:26,61 --> 00:46:28,1
Because I've got to rest my brain

468
00:46:28,1 --> 00:46:33,77
and I feel like I do know how do you know take care of myself so I can get where I need to be to do great work.

469
00:46:33,78 --> 00:46:37,09
But it's like recharging your batteries. You know doing nothing.

470
00:46:37,31 --> 00:46:41,05
Not really thinking just some quiet time I don't mean meditating or anything.

471
00:46:41,18 --> 00:46:45,99
I'm just thinking like I'm at home really hours are going like what I did this morning just didn't really do anything

472
00:46:47,46 --> 00:46:52,81
but you know what not really necessary.

473
00:46:53,19 --> 00:46:58,1
Think about nothing like I'm cleaning up more minor things that don't require a lot of brainpower.

474
00:46:58,97 --> 00:47:07,48
You know clean up doing some laundry. You know making plans for whatever I have to do later.

475
00:47:07,5 --> 00:47:14,73
So yeah parking research exactly.

476
00:47:14,75 --> 00:47:19,48
Like I liken it to an athlete who you can't be training all the time I mean that would be negative.

477
00:47:19,61 --> 00:47:30,03
That would be negative for doing well actually into rests a little one of my lympics OK now I don't have anything

478
00:47:30,03 --> 00:47:33,05
equivalent to the Olympics because we're not competing you know on a.

479
00:47:33,16 --> 00:47:40,66
Just so the one kilometer race or four hundred meter dash but when I want to be in the zone and do my best work.

480
00:47:40,9 --> 00:47:44,74
I have to be you know. Ready for it.

481
00:47:44,81 --> 00:48:00,23
So I'd say that would be like one of the races the time when I'm really trying to work with a gold medal.

482
00:48:00,25 --> 00:48:02,53
That's probably not the best analogy actually.

483
00:48:04,36 --> 00:48:11,2
But it does take a tremendous amount of energy to to think what sounds funny saying that but if I go to work

484
00:48:11,2 --> 00:48:14,34
and I think really hard all day. I actually come home completely exhausted.

485
00:48:15,64 --> 00:48:17,6
You know I've done no exercise haven't walked upstairs

486
00:48:17,6 --> 00:48:23,06
or haven't you know all day so it seems like people know if you're going all day hike

487
00:48:23,06 --> 00:48:24,61
or you do some major thing physically.

488
00:48:25,25 --> 00:48:29,43
You can just be wiped out at the end of the day and like ready to fall asleep in the instant but thinking actually

489
00:48:29,43 --> 00:48:38,27
when I think very hard problem solve it takes that huge amount of energy in what way.

490
00:48:38,32 --> 00:48:45,31
Might give me here headache or just I can't solve the problem or them so well and then I don't have that

491
00:48:45,31 --> 00:48:51,67
when I'm thinking about work but sometimes I have it. In other situations actually I've seen my friends have it too.

492
00:48:51,69 --> 00:48:57,84
I was just at a conference and four of us who were friends were all at the same conference we started talking

493
00:48:59,19 --> 00:49:04,37
and one of them had that moment where she thought she was going crazy but two of us were talking rapidly

494
00:49:05,81 --> 00:49:10,57
and we kept switching topics. Because we had been in an email chain about a project we're doing.

495
00:49:10,58 --> 00:49:12,99
And she had thought she was just losing it.

496
00:49:13,07 --> 00:49:16,67
But when we explained that we had two different conversations going on and we were jumping back

497
00:49:16,67 --> 00:49:22,58
and forth she felt relief. Sometimes Overthinking gets you in trouble that way because.

498
00:49:23,3 --> 00:49:30,01
You think you might of gotten very confused about something but you find out that it's it's not you was the situation.

499
00:49:34,74 --> 00:49:51,63
When. OK Let me think about that one.

500
00:49:54,71 --> 00:49:58,71
So there are a lot of chases like that there are a lot of cases like that where you go down a path.

501
00:49:59,79 --> 00:50:04,15
Imagine it's like exploring in the wilderness and you just can't get through and you have to back off.

502
00:50:05,15 --> 00:50:08,45
And you park it in a way I'm thinking I want to go there again future

503
00:50:09,36 --> 00:50:13,47
and I do have one particular problem I can't figure out actually unfortunately we couldn't even

504
00:50:13,47 --> 00:50:20,65
when I asked my best student for the past great with physics the two of us even couldn't solve this problem

505
00:50:20,65 --> 00:50:27,14
and the reason is because. I can. Well we're.

506
00:50:27,16 --> 00:50:32,1
We're trying to describe a situation in which the limits of planet can be stable a split can be unstable

507
00:50:32,1 --> 00:50:35,27
and just evaporate if it doesn't have enough gravity it can't hold onto its material

508
00:50:36,27 --> 00:50:42,12
but the equations we're using only describe a planet that is bound together so we don't even have the tools

509
00:50:42,12 --> 00:50:45,87
and this is a good example we have no tools and we don't know how to handle this problem.

510
00:50:45,89 --> 00:50:48,38
So I decided to leave that problem.

511
00:50:48,38 --> 00:50:52,34
I didn't get mad and I kind of got a little mad I'll only get really mad if someone else figures it out

512
00:50:52,34 --> 00:50:58,28
and publishes it. But for now instead of me because I know it's a great idea but I'm not one hundred percent.

513
00:50:58,67 --> 00:51:08,19
It's a great idea. So I'm waiting for more data to accumulate so I can know whether or not this idea is good. Or.

514
00:51:13,23 --> 00:51:23,87
Often very often. Or. Often there's. Let me think for a second.

515
00:51:27,96 --> 00:51:33,99
Sometimes it's a practical reason I don't have time or resources or people to carry out that particular problem.

516
00:51:34,68 --> 00:51:40,84
Other times it's just not a priority one can have so many ideas and just not nearly enough time to pursue them

517
00:51:42,18 --> 00:51:43,4
and other times it's just too hard.

518
00:51:44,3 --> 00:51:46,42
The kind of tools that we'd have to develop to work on it

519
00:51:47,27 --> 00:51:52,97
or just figuring out the right physics we need to solve the problem is just beyond what I can do.

520
00:51:54,15 --> 00:51:57,21
Sometimes it gets parked forever. Sometimes it's part two.

521
00:51:57,21 --> 00:52:01,73
I meet the person with the right skills like my biochemistry colleagues who I can work with.

522
00:52:02,5 --> 00:52:04,08
Other times it's just part until the summer.

523
00:52:04,36 --> 00:52:10,25
Until I have time that I'm not teaching or dealing with university tasks to have some time to think through it.

524
00:52:12,07 --> 00:52:22,83
But I can also imagine that you story from what you an idea.

525
00:52:22,85 --> 00:52:36,06
Like this is promising me also if I just have some time or some team to help me it was right.

526
00:52:36,94 --> 00:52:42,74
Sometimes it's definitely frustrating. But part of life is choosing what's important.

527
00:52:43,01 --> 00:52:47,12
What's not and so you know sometimes you just have to choose the one that's important. Go with it.

528
00:52:47,98 --> 00:52:51,99
It's also harder now than it used to be I think when you're younger with less responsibility.

529
00:52:52,01 --> 00:52:56,75
You can just drop everything and focus on that problem you think is so important and really make traction

530
00:52:56,75 --> 00:52:57,29
and finish it.

531
00:52:58,22 --> 00:53:00,29
And now there's just so much going on in just my job

532
00:53:00,29 --> 00:53:06,88
and home that it's harder to just drop things to just focus on one thing.

533
00:53:09,51 --> 00:53:19,7
Where you saw it with this you know while you're alone with your own mind.

534
00:53:21,96 --> 00:53:49,87
And you're thinking of you do you try to see equations or you know what is what is the. Reality.

535
00:53:51,5 --> 00:53:58,53
Well I've never tried to articulate it before.

536
00:53:58,54 --> 00:54:04,14
OK sometimes there's a flash of not colors or light or anything that there's a flash of thinking like a conclusion.

537
00:54:04,36 --> 00:54:16,16
It's reached in advance of getting their groove reach and yes it's kind of like I'll be working away at something

538
00:54:16,16 --> 00:54:26,00
and then I'll kind of get that almost like the only way I can describe it in the best case is.

539
00:54:26,72 --> 00:54:35,25
Like I realize what the answer is before I get there. And find out. I have to find out how to get there.

540
00:54:35,25 --> 00:54:39,78
Sometimes it's a negative. Where in the cell and I'm working I just realize it's not going to work.

541
00:54:40,7 --> 00:54:45,16
But I still want to do my due diligence to make sure that this idea is not going to pan out to be sure that it's NOT

542
00:54:45,16 --> 00:54:49,59
have to be sure that's not right or right even in that case but if you when you close your eyes

543
00:54:49,59 --> 00:55:08,96
when you're in the zone when you see I don't know if I can answer that. Actually I don't know. So somehow I think.

544
00:55:10,13 --> 00:55:15,26
Scientists and artists and let's say. Way of thinking I think so.

545
00:55:16,13 --> 00:55:34,62
Well what's the way the artists think in the sound is so true and if you do any kind of work and make a baby.

546
00:55:34,82 --> 00:55:43,03
He's got from what I write goes yes yes yes with reality.

547
00:55:43,06 --> 00:56:02,47
You only difference is the artist for what I do but also to live life you have I think you're going to. I think so.

548
00:56:04,36 --> 00:56:28,65
Because you're always certain you will never get to see it and know who's always bigger

549
00:56:28,65 --> 00:56:39,67
or the thing is I feel like I am one person out of a long chain of people in all directions.

550
00:56:40,58 --> 00:56:44,67
And so I feel I'll be satisfied if I can accomplish. You know my goal or my life's work.

551
00:56:45,75 --> 00:56:48,14
As long as the next person in front of me is ready to go.

552
00:56:48,22 --> 00:56:55,96
So I may never reach what truth is or what I say even what I set out in the biggest sense of the word

553
00:56:55,96 --> 00:57:01,94
but as long as I know it will be carried on or someone else will keep the search going I'm OK with it. Yeah.

554
00:57:06,37 --> 00:57:28,18
You know maybe go back to. Oh please let me. You know we don't fall.

555
00:57:28,19 --> 00:57:36,55
The data that my team works with come from the Hubble Space Telescope. And the Spitzer Space Telescope.

556
00:57:41,49 --> 00:57:54,07
Well the ultimate form we want to convert the data into look like points on a graph as a function of wavelength.

557
00:57:54,28 --> 00:57:58,72
So we've visible wavelengths where I can see an infrared wavelengths where he cameras can see

558
00:57:59,56 --> 00:58:08,48
and each point has an arab are associated with it and uncertainty of the measurement. And so we just kind of have data.

559
00:58:08,5 --> 00:58:11,73
That as a function of wavelength

560
00:58:11,73 --> 00:58:19,1
and we look for patterns in the data another set of data we use is a time series of data.

561
00:58:19,11 --> 00:58:21,44
And these data come from the Kepler space telescope.

562
00:58:22,13 --> 00:58:26,72
And their data point taken every few seconds but it's been to thirty minutes

563
00:58:27,68 --> 00:58:36,75
and it's on a time sequence so we have one point of a star how bright it is as a function of time.

564
00:58:36,77 --> 00:58:43,49
So these are mostly in minutes minutes or minutes but each point will be every minute

565
00:58:43,49 --> 00:58:49,96
or every thirty minutes depending on which mode that particular target star was observed in.

566
00:58:51,38 --> 00:59:03,29
This point where you are right because these star shaped stars the stars. You know.

567
00:59:07,47 --> 00:59:21,72
OK the baffle me you know we call that a baffle. Because what is this test right.

568
00:59:24,37 --> 00:59:30,7
So OK Well first of all just to back up a little there's many different telescopes

569
00:59:30,7 --> 00:59:36,45
and projects that are ongoing different groups of people all around the world have different projects they're trying to

570
00:59:36,45 --> 00:59:43,21
move forward. The ones I'm involved with. One of them is called Test transiting exoplanet Survey Satellite.

571
00:59:43,83 --> 00:59:46,17
And test is the NASA mission.

572
00:59:46,19 --> 00:59:48,41
It costs two hundred million dollars overall

573
00:59:49,33 --> 00:59:53,57
but for space you have to imagine everything costs one hundred times more than on the ground.

574
00:59:53,58 --> 00:59:58,69
Tests is a space is this test is a satellite the orbiter.

575
00:59:59,06 --> 01:00:03,94
It has a very elliptical orbit so it can spend most of its time away from Earth's the heat and light from Earth.

576
01:00:04,36 --> 01:00:11,01
It was zoom around while it downlinks data and it will spend thirteen point six days away from Earth in a few hours.

577
01:00:11,09 --> 01:00:16,16
You mean by. It will spend each of two orbits on one patch of the sky.

578
01:00:16,86 --> 01:00:22,09
And in two years tests will survey the whole sky looking at stars measuring their brightness as a function of time

579
01:00:23,42 --> 01:00:26,74
searching for planets that transit their host stars they go in front of the star.

580
01:00:27,09 --> 01:00:34,09
And they block out a tiny amount of starlight while they're transitting. And the goal for test actually.

581
01:00:34,62 --> 01:00:41,67
Is to uncover a pool of planets of rocky planets transiting small stars stars much smaller than the sun.

582
01:00:42,32 --> 01:00:43,27
And those stars

583
01:00:43,27 --> 01:00:50,77
and their planets are the first ones that will be able to search for signs of life in the atmosphere using the James

584
01:00:50,77 --> 01:00:54,44
Webb Space Telescope which is the next Hubble Space Telescope if you will.

585
01:00:55,78 --> 01:01:01,79
So we have actually we're working on our very practical plans to find the planets around stars that are close enough to

586
01:01:01,79 --> 01:01:01,92
earth.

587
01:01:01,94 --> 01:01:09,18
So they're bright enough and will look for signs of life in their atmosphere using the James Webb Space Telescope.

588
01:01:09,19 --> 01:01:23,32
So this. OK so the star she does something totally different.

589
01:01:23,73 --> 01:01:31,78
So we'll talk that's way next generation after tests all test itself is actually you know Tessa's it is just for

590
01:01:31,78 --> 01:01:36,96
essentially specialized telephoto lenses. They don't focus they're just fixed.

591
01:01:37,08 --> 01:01:39,96
They have about seven different lenses inside.

592
01:01:40,43 --> 01:01:45,01
They're made almost to be perfectly for no vignetting they're a thermal So they're not going to heat up

593
01:01:45,01 --> 01:01:49,43
or cool down in weird ways and there's four of them attached to a single platform.

594
01:01:49,45 --> 01:01:55,43
And those telescopes believe it or not those cameras they cover a strip of sky ninety degrees by twenty four degrees.

595
01:01:55,55 --> 01:02:02,54
So it's like if you look at the night sky it's like from your horizon all the way to the pole almost that whole strip.

596
01:02:02,56 --> 01:02:04,58
And it's going to twelve of those all across. Sky.

597
01:02:04,93 --> 01:02:10,48
And what Tess is looking for is just measuring star brightness as a function of time every few minutes

598
01:02:10,48 --> 01:02:17,01
or so it'll have a data point. And what Tess is looking for is a special configuration of planetary orbit.

599
01:02:17,27 --> 01:02:25,87
We call it a transit. It's when if we have a star the planet goes in front of the star as seen from the telescope.

600
01:02:25,88 --> 01:02:31,53
And while the star is just a point of light it will drop in brightness by a tiny tiny amount one percent

601
01:02:31,53 --> 01:02:34,38
or a fraction of a percent when the planet goes in front of the star.

602
01:02:35,62 --> 01:02:41,3
And that's what we're looking for this is been pioneered already by the Kepler Space Telescope which found.

603
01:02:41,31 --> 01:02:43,91
Which found thousands of planets transit the star.

604
01:02:44,37 --> 01:02:54,13
And Tess is repeating that experiment but with stars that are much closer to Earth than the coupler stars are.

605
01:02:54,15 --> 01:03:00,64
Well you know the star she comes in is right now I want you to know about these transiting planets are very important.

606
01:03:00,97 --> 01:03:05,37
They're really the main thing we're doing an exoplanet because they're easy to find

607
01:03:06,8 --> 01:03:08,91
but they have to be specially lined up.

608
01:03:08,93 --> 01:03:14,92
Planets orbit since the stellar spin axes it's all random stars are born out of they can collapse this way

609
01:03:14,92 --> 01:03:18,32
or they can collapse this way so transiting planets are very special

610
01:03:18,32 --> 01:03:24,1
and they're also quite rare our own Earth for example is so far from our star.

611
01:03:24,11 --> 01:03:31,12
That if we're looking for an Earth Sun twin only one in two hundred would transit.

612
01:03:31,14 --> 01:03:36,16
An analogy for you is like throwing darts at a dartboard if you're really close to that dart board you can easily get

613
01:03:36,16 --> 01:03:40,02
to the center of the dart board but the further away you go the harder it is because you're angle smaller.

614
01:03:41,1 --> 01:03:47,37
So for Earth and Sun It's actually quite rare that they'll transit and so if we want to find an Earth twin.

615
01:03:47,39 --> 01:03:49,31
If we want to go beyond transiting planets.

616
01:03:49,48 --> 01:03:53,01
We actually eventually have to use a totally different technique than Kepler and tests

617
01:03:53,01 --> 01:03:58,26
and things that are going on now we have to be able to block out the star light so we can see the planet directly.

618
01:03:59,75 --> 01:04:04,27
So in exoplanets it's complicated. We have many different ways to find planets at least six different way.

619
01:04:04,36 --> 01:04:07,17
Maybe seven maybe thirty if you read like pedia.

620
01:04:07,47 --> 01:04:13,36
But it's so many different ways and they're all for a different goal transits are something we can do right now today.

621
01:04:15,4 --> 01:04:17,52
That they rely on a very special configuration

622
01:04:18,42 --> 01:04:24,13
and just to be a little more technical for transmitting planet the drop in brightness is related to the area of the

623
01:04:24,13 --> 01:04:30,41
planet compared to the area of the star. Because that's how much light we're blocking out imagine like a big circle.

624
01:04:30,59 --> 01:04:37,29
That's the star not little circle little disk that's the planet our own Earth actually blocks out about one part in ten

625
01:04:37,29 --> 01:04:41,37
thousand the light of our sun if there's an alien civilization looking back at us

626
01:04:41,37 --> 01:04:43,05
and they have a Kepler space telescope.

627
01:04:43,21 --> 01:04:50,07
They need to measure a star to precision so they can see a drop in brightness of one part in ten thousand

628
01:04:51,1 --> 01:05:01,55
and it's pretty small. Well where we are detectable because our Kepler space telescope can detect. Who the aliens.

629
01:05:02,32 --> 01:05:07,15
Oh they might they might actually because Kepler was the easiest telescope for us to build actually.

630
01:05:07,79 --> 01:05:12,19
So I'm just setting the stage for you to see just how hard planet find is one part in ten thousand I mean do you have

631
01:05:12,19 --> 01:05:16,57
ever have to measure anything to one part in ten thousand like when you're building a renovation

632
01:05:16,57 --> 01:05:21,92
or you know even our project you're not measuring things to four decimal places. It's just not happening.

633
01:05:23,07 --> 01:05:26,31
Now if we want to forget about transiting plants for a moment cause they're rare

634
01:05:27,42 --> 01:05:30,61
and we may run out of them if we're looking for an earth around a nearby sun.

635
01:05:31,78 --> 01:05:34,24
Now we have an even harder problem because our Earth

636
01:05:34,24 --> 01:05:41,26
and reflected light invisible wavelengths that were our ice can see were stars are bright Earth is ten billion times

637
01:05:41,26 --> 01:05:46,43
fainter than the Sun so it's no longer one part in ten thousand we're worried about it's one part in ten billion

638
01:05:47,31 --> 01:05:48,82
and the reason is it's not just the area

639
01:05:48,82 --> 01:05:55,14
but light drops off you know if you're shining a flask flashlight outside of the beam is spreading out the light is

640
01:05:55,14 --> 01:06:00,05
dropping off actually it's weakening with distance and so the sunlight has to travel that distance to hit the earth

641
01:06:00,05 --> 01:06:04,02
and that sunlight is weakening and so with that reflected light.

642
01:06:04,36 --> 01:06:06,82
From the Sun from an Earth sized planets a very very small.

643
01:06:08,15 --> 01:06:13,78
So imagine we're looking for a planet like Earth and it's faint enough itself.

644
01:06:15,09 --> 01:06:19,2
But that fitness is not that our problem in astronomy it's the fact that the Earth out there.

645
01:06:19,2 --> 01:06:24,42
We're looking for is right next to a very bright star the stars ten billion times brighter so we have to suppress the

646
01:06:24,42 --> 01:06:27,74
star light or block out the star light to one part in ten billion.

647
01:06:27,76 --> 01:06:32,22
So the star shade if you will like our next step after we finish with translating planets we're going to do what we

648
01:06:32,22 --> 01:06:35,75
call direct imaging we're going to block out the star light so we can see the planets directly

649
01:06:35,75 --> 01:06:38,64
and we already do this from ground based telescopes.

650
01:06:38,66 --> 01:06:43,02
Only we're reaching one part in one hundred thousand not one part in ten billion.

651
01:06:44,44 --> 01:06:47,77
So we have many more decimal places still difficult.

652
01:06:48,16 --> 01:06:50,03
So the star shape is going to go to space

653
01:06:51,47 --> 01:06:59,24
and it's going to have to formation fly tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope in the star shape is a

654
01:06:59,24 --> 01:07:04,31
very specially shape screen that's tens of meters across and this whole thing will line up

655
01:07:04,31 --> 01:07:07,99
and block out the star light so that only the planet light is entering the telescope

656
01:07:09,11 --> 01:07:13,14
and the star she will move across the sky and realign with a new target star over and over again.

657
01:07:17,36 --> 01:07:25,00
It's going to be exciting. It's going to work if the star shade was not my idea but yes.

658
01:07:26,32 --> 01:07:32,65
Recently I led the team that was running the Starship project for about two years.

659
01:07:33,36 --> 01:07:38,44
And we actually brought star shade from being a crazy concept like someone's vision or dream

660
01:07:38,44 --> 01:07:41,8
or fantasy into mainstream astronomy

661
01:07:41,8 --> 01:07:48,08
and we were able to pull together all the groups who've been working on Star shade making technology work here testing

662
01:07:48,08 --> 01:07:49,21
starship in the desert there

663
01:07:50,05 --> 01:07:54,89
and we kind of brought everything up to a level now where it's surprising just in a couple of years.

664
01:07:54,89 --> 01:07:57,54
Astronomers no longer say Star shade. That's dead.

665
01:07:57,61 --> 01:08:01,81
It's never going to work there like of course we want to try to do star shade.

666
01:08:01,83 --> 01:08:04,02
And this actually project I led was a study.

667
01:08:04,36 --> 01:08:08,89
That a NASA sponsored study we can get into more details if you want but that's how I was involved with Star shade.

668
01:08:10,6 --> 01:08:14,38
Yes because you know what's really cool is I have one of the petals of the star shade prototype.

669
01:08:14,51 --> 01:08:19,77
It's five and a half meters. Well because the whole star shade depending on what version you.

670
01:08:19,85 --> 01:08:24,11
We will get funded in the future could be thirty meters across

671
01:08:25,51 --> 01:08:28,59
and each petal is between is will these particular ones are five

672
01:08:28,59 --> 01:08:33,03
and a half meters I can show you some videos later too that will help explain it.

673
01:08:34,06 --> 01:08:38,00
Yes I have the starship petal and I have another artifact.

674
01:08:38,06 --> 01:08:42,69
I'm not sure if it'll get back on time because I was in Washington on the weekend in the.

675
01:08:42,7 --> 01:08:50,16
Level one percent scale version. It's about one meter in diameter. It's a star shaped one percent for size.

676
01:08:51,16 --> 01:08:53,52
It doesn't move this particular one was used in the desert.

677
01:08:53,84 --> 01:09:01,89
It's just like a piece of metal cutout it was used in desert testing where Northrop Grumman Corporation sent a team

678
01:09:01,89 --> 01:09:03,99
repeatedly out to the desert in the Vada.

679
01:09:04,63 --> 01:09:09,76
And they're trying to make sure that the math works that the stars in the very special shape really does block light

680
01:09:09,76 --> 01:09:13,83
the way we expect and they'd have a camera and L.E.D.

681
01:09:13,83 --> 01:09:20,5
Fake star and planet in the star shape blocking out the light of the star so they can see the planets directly.

682
01:09:21,68 --> 01:09:47,43
I can send you some photographs on this as well. So you have the whole story together. Of course. But. OK.

683
01:09:47,49 --> 01:09:51,09
Like literally when I dream or you mean figurative Lee When I dream about the future.

684
01:09:53,87 --> 01:09:58,05
A Literally the funny thing was literally I just I dreamed I was at a conference and just wanted to go home.

685
01:09:59,02 --> 01:10:03,17
So that's kind of my usual life story. I'm on a trip somewhere and I just really don't want to be there.

686
01:10:05,43 --> 01:10:11,89
One of the problems. Yes So my dreams are really not that.

687
01:10:11,91 --> 01:10:17,84
I know I do I tend to dream that I know that's right I have a very realistic dreams just about my everyday life like

688
01:10:17,84 --> 01:10:24,15
when I'm sleeping I'm not dreaming about you know some great adventure of meeting the only instance of like in this

689
01:10:24,15 --> 01:10:29,59
movie Aliens. RIPLEY the main character constantly is dreaming that she was harboring one of these aliens.

690
01:10:29,77 --> 01:10:32,88
You know because they use human bodies is host and speaking out. So I don't really dream.

691
01:10:33,43 --> 01:10:36,74
Literally dreaming like when I'm sleeping that I'm finding a planet or anything.

692
01:10:36,89 --> 01:10:51,28
And fortunately no my dreams are quite tedious and. Usually that.

693
01:10:54,35 --> 01:11:01,36
OK Why do I have more a more pragmatic person actually so I have to I can probably I wouldn't I actually need some time

694
01:11:01,36 --> 01:11:25,07
to think about your questions. They're so good but if you think I do have a dream though. OK I'll take my time.

695
01:11:25,09 --> 01:11:30,92
Well in my dreams planets are everywhere they really are and they're just waiting for us to find them.

696
01:11:31,16 --> 01:11:34,13
And I literally dream of the data we're going to be getting.

697
01:11:34,43 --> 01:11:38,54
And I know it's not going to be spectacular data it's going to be you know our first try.

698
01:11:38,69 --> 01:11:42,2
And I literally dream of the data coming down and finding what we're looking for.

699
01:11:43,26 --> 01:11:49,7
And I believe in my dream so strongly. You know that will be finding oxygen and other gases that don't belong.

700
01:11:49,72 --> 01:11:57,00
But my dream goes a lot further because at some level I I do you know I may not accomplish everything I want in my

701
01:11:57,00 --> 01:12:01,59
lifetime and so my dream extends to my students some of them who are really like my own children.

702
01:12:02,72 --> 01:12:05,93
And I I want them to carry the dream on actually.

703
01:12:06,5 --> 01:12:12,16
And so I do dream of an amazing future whale well beyond what I'm going to accomplish in my life where we have

704
01:12:12,16 --> 01:12:14,43
incredible things happening in space. We have self.

705
01:12:14,5 --> 01:12:15,49
We have self-assembly

706
01:12:16,52 --> 01:12:22,82
or space telescopes we can make telescopes that are bigger than anything we imagined fabrication in space.

707
01:12:22,85 --> 01:12:28,47
We're building giant telescopes and I imagine the future of having just such great data.

708
01:12:28,75 --> 01:12:30,87
That the generation just beyond me.

709
01:12:30,89 --> 01:12:36,19
Can have unequivocal wonderful beautiful data that the signals are so strong

710
01:12:36,19 --> 01:12:38,77
and there's no question that they're seeing spectral features

711
01:12:38,77 --> 01:12:42,53
and that they can sort through all the different possibilities and make a robust claim of life.

712
01:12:43,08 --> 01:12:48,51
On another world and in my dream saw a life then I'm just a hundred years old.

713
01:12:48,53 --> 01:12:51,02
With my husband Charles you know traveling around to conferences

714
01:12:51,02 --> 01:13:00,28
and getting to enjoy the success of the seeds that I planted and I wish my student Mary was around she's actually.

715
01:13:00,83 --> 01:13:05,01
She actually was in the Netherlands actually a low for this big radio telescope you have there.

716
01:13:05,04 --> 01:13:11,32
It's spread out all across the country. Now she's in Belgium but she's one of my people actually my protege's.

717
01:13:12,1 --> 01:13:14,77
I mean she'll probably know unfortunately she's in Europe right now

718
01:13:14,77 --> 01:13:19,38
but I'm just saying that she would like there are some of my students I do really.

719
01:13:19,6 --> 01:13:21,22
I'm really attached to actually when trained.

720
01:13:21,29 --> 01:13:24,82
I mean obviously they're not going to do just what I want them to do in their life just like real children you know.

721
01:13:25,03 --> 01:13:28,06
Don't go and do what you have a plan for them they usually don't do that plan

722
01:13:28,77 --> 01:13:41,53
but I do see a great future exactly like I didn't do it. My father wanted me to yeah. So.

723
01:13:43,1 --> 01:13:49,66
For your you know the thing is like academic life is quite tough actually I mean you're going to see me so successful

724
01:13:49,66 --> 01:13:53,29
and it looks like a great life and I have time and I can do whatever I want

725
01:13:53,29 --> 01:13:58,29
and I have a lot of respect I can I can do whatever I want really and people won't cross me

726
01:13:59,16 --> 01:14:03,35
but it's hard to get there and so I'm not sure if I wish that life for my children of just kind of struggling

727
01:14:03,35 --> 01:14:08,19
and low pay for a while and really you know I want them to find something that they love doing that they're good at.

728
01:14:08,4 --> 01:14:10,64
Because I think that's what needs to be successful.

729
01:14:12,01 --> 01:14:13,89
I think as a parent to it's a little more practical

730
01:14:13,89 --> 01:14:19,06
and I hadn't realised this about why my dad had the reaction he did when I told him I wanted to be an astronomer.

731
01:14:19,72 --> 01:14:23,2
This is a parent you want your children to be self-sufficient. You know you want them to get out there.

732
01:14:23,77 --> 01:14:27,49
So you don't have to support them. Later in their life you know in the moving back home.

733
01:14:28,5 --> 01:14:32,08
You want to be out there and launched we call it and just doing their own thing.

734
01:14:33,04 --> 01:14:38,00
So I have a vision for my children where I want them to be to find a job that works for them

735
01:14:38,00 --> 01:14:42,17
and a lifestyle that they want and I recognize that might not be the same thing that I want for myself

736
01:14:43,12 --> 01:14:46,38
but of course all that said I do secretly hope that one of them does carry on my dream.

737
01:14:46,7 --> 01:14:52,27
Like the I'm going to look into I love the story of the parent and child like growing up and working together

738
01:14:53,17 --> 01:15:00,06
but I feel like they need to carve their own path.

739
01:15:13,98 --> 01:15:33,15
What planets around because they have so much mass there gravity wants to pull them in to us here. So. OK.

740
01:15:33,16 --> 01:15:44,45
Exoplanets scientifically get named after their parent star. So for example we have a star called Upsilon Andromeda.

741
01:15:44,47 --> 01:15:49,81
And when planets were found. They're named Upsilon Andromeda B C D Not too exciting.

742
01:15:50,45 --> 01:15:54,63
And to confuse the matter planets are named in order of their distance from the star

743
01:15:54,63 --> 01:15:59,6
but their order named in order of discovery. So might have Planet be out here and then C. and Then D.

744
01:15:59,6 --> 01:16:00,96
That makes it very confusing.

745
01:16:01,29 --> 01:16:06,75
We have other stars where the stars themselves never had names until a planet was discovered.

746
01:16:06,9 --> 01:16:09,06
Such as Kepler one eighty six.

747
01:16:09,26 --> 01:16:25,58
That would have been Kepler is one hundred eighty sixth Star with the planet found around it.

748
01:16:14,13 --> 01:16:27,62
and those planets would be called Kepler one eighty six B. C. D. E. F. But I'm going to finish the naming question.

749
01:16:28,1 --> 01:16:32,37
Because for a long time we wanted to just name the stars name the planets ourselves

750
01:16:32,37 --> 01:16:36,12
but astronomers don't have the right to do that even if I discover a planet.

751
01:16:36,14 --> 01:16:40,24
I can't name after my child or pet or anything. It's actually not allowed.

752
01:16:40,29 --> 01:16:42,63
And at one point astronomers started to name them

753
01:16:42,63 --> 01:16:48,27
and other people other Strummer's got angry Well you didn't discover that I work on that planet just as much as you do.

754
01:16:48,29 --> 01:16:49,47
Why do you get the right to name it.

755
01:16:49,61 --> 01:16:55,81
So people get all upset about it but recently I'm pleased to tell you that the International Astronomical Union.

756
01:16:55,83 --> 01:17:01,56
The international body that's responsible for naming astronomical objects opened up a competition to the public

757
01:17:02,62 --> 01:17:07,67
and they let different groups first register so individuals weren't allowed but you could be like an astronomy club

758
01:17:07,67 --> 01:17:13,9
or a school group and not and suggest names and then people are allowed to vote on which names they liked

759
01:17:13,9 --> 01:17:20,18
and so eventually a bunch of the planets were named the stars and planets were given names.

760
01:17:20,2 --> 01:17:24,43
Like I wasn't actually no no in fact we were not thinking of them to be honest.

761
01:17:25,03 --> 01:17:36,95
To remember the name of five thousand different planets is way too hard and so in the scientific sense..

762
01:17:30,28 --> 01:17:36,95
We actually like our original naming system. Because if the star is named H D one eight nine seven three three B.

763
01:17:36,99 --> 01:17:40,92
That's the planet name. We know that it's a sun like star because H.D.

764
01:17:40,92 --> 01:17:45,87
Is after a catalog by man named Henry Henry Draper who went out and catalogued all the bright sun like stars.

765
01:17:46,00 --> 01:17:51,21
If it's glees five it when see. Please was another person who named all the red dwarf stars.

766
01:17:51,3 --> 01:17:54,35
Then we know it's a red dwarf star if it's Kepler one eight six F.

767
01:17:54,35 --> 01:17:59,2
We know it's from the Kepler survey so the names as arcane as they may sound they actually work for us.

768
01:18:00,88 --> 01:18:24,26
More like a code the code is more useful than an actual. Actually it's certainly possible.

769
01:18:26,41 --> 01:18:29,84
This happens has not happened to me yet but it has definitely happened in kind.

770
01:18:29,99 --> 01:18:32,32
I'd like to be an example of what happened next. The planets.

771
01:18:33,31 --> 01:18:40,52
One thing that we don't understand how planets form because we all expected going out there searching for planets that

772
01:18:40,52 --> 01:18:49,82
we would simply find solar system copies a star Mercury Venus Earth Mars bigger planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune.

773
01:18:49,84 --> 01:18:50,49
And wow.

774
01:18:50,64 --> 01:18:59,59
Astronomers found Jupiter's we're on earth should be where Jupiter orbiting it starts closer to its sun we found

775
01:18:59,59 --> 01:19:05,98
Jupiter's ten times closer to their star the mercury is to our sun we found what we call hot super Earths planets.

776
01:19:06,17 --> 01:19:10,04
So close to the star the surface should be hot enough to melt rock

777
01:19:10,8 --> 01:19:16,71
and we see planets with one day period orbits their year is only one a day so we found so many planets is just crazy.

778
01:19:17,08 --> 01:19:19,02
Now people worked on planet formation.

779
01:19:20,11 --> 01:19:24,95
First of all they never predicted this huge range of planetary systems and the funny thing is that.

780
01:19:25,03 --> 01:19:28,07
That off these planet from ation theorists would say.

781
01:19:28,53 --> 01:19:38,55
We predict there will be no planets between one to four masses at orbiting at some distance to their star

782
01:19:38,55 --> 01:19:44,76
and they consciously made predictions like that as soon as our telescopes our instruments could reach smaller planets

783
01:19:45,51 --> 01:19:47,05
their predictions were just completely wrong.

784
01:19:48,17 --> 01:19:52,5
So actually has happened over and over again at least in that field where people predict things

785
01:19:52,5 --> 01:19:55,09
and they end up being completely wrong. So when I give you an example.

786
01:19:55,29 --> 01:20:03,00
It's the obviously easier to blame other people than it is to think of your own work but it always it is possible. OK.

787
01:20:03,61 --> 01:20:09,88
It's certainly possible that you think of something and you have a plan you imagine something and you work it out

788
01:20:09,88 --> 01:20:12,57
and you're sure you're going to find it and you don't find it can happen.
