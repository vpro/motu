This directory contains the cached term clouds, which are automatically generated from the interview transcripts using this online service: http://termextract.fivefilters.org

It is possible to edit the cached files. Doing so would update the tag cloud displayed on the corresponding scientist page on the website.

Whenever the transcript files of a scientist are updated, please delete the corresponding cached file in this folder, so it will be generated again from the latest transcript.

That's all, thank you.
